Additionally, UCBs must obtain prior approval from the Registrar of Co-operative Societies before admitting leasing or hire-purchase companies as members if they are not exclusively engaged in these activities.",
            "generated_answer": "Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) should generally not provide finance to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) except for direct loans against security. However, if a UCB has a leasing company or hire-purchase company as a member, it may be permissible to provide loans to these companies under specific conditions. These conditions include ensuring that such loans are backed by tangible security and not considered part of the bank's capital. The UCB must also establish an internal board-approved policy that addresses the risks involved in financing NBFCs and leasing/hire-purchase companies, including guidelines for credit limits, loan-to-value ratios, and recovery norms. This policy should be reviewed at least once a year, especially following any changes in management. Additionally, the UCB must report details of its lending to leasing and hire-purchase companies to the Department of Regulation (DoR), Reserve Bank of India (RBI) annually.

            "question": "What is the role of the Reserve Bank of India in assigning lead bank responsibility when a new district is created, and why is this done?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "When a new district is formed, the Reserve Bank of India assigns a specific bank to take the lead in banking and development activities within that district. This ensures focused attention on financial inclusion and economic progress in the newly formed area.",
            "generated_answer": "When a new district is formed, the Reserve Bank of India assigns a lead bank to coordinate banking activities within the district. This ensures effective financial inclusion and development, especially for rural areas. The lead bank also plays a critical role in monitoring banking progress, promoting financial literacy, and facilitating business development in the region. If the lead bank's performance is unsatisfactory, it may be replaced by another bank. Banks must adhere to guidelines issued by the RBI regarding their responsibilities as lead banks. The assignment of lead bank responsibilities follows specific criteria, including the number of banks operating in the district and existing lead bank responsibilities. The lead bank designation lasts until the next census update. In cases where a bank's leadership changes, the new leader automatically assumes the lead bank responsibility. If a bank ceases operations due to insolvency or liquidation, the lead bank designation is assigned to its largest competitor. The lead bank designation is communicated through a notification in the Gazette of India, ensuring accountability and coordination among banking institutions. Banks are expected to actively participate in the lead bank program, addressing issues like poor road connectivity, lack of electricity, and outdated technology. The Government of India also provides incentives for banks that excel in promoting financial inclusion, such as an interest subvention of 3% per annum on loans up to \u20b95 lakh for MSME units, a 4% interest subvention on credit up to \u20b910 lakh for women SHG groups, and an interest subvention of 3% per annum on credit up to \u20b95 lakh for agricultural units. These incentives aim to promote financial inclusion and economic growth in rural areas. For districts newly covered under the Lead Bank Scheme, incentives are provided based on the number of days the scheme has been operational. Banks must adhere to prescribed norms for maintaining good customer service and avoiding fraud, as outlined in the Master Direction on Supervisory and Regulatory Practices (MDSRP). Banks should also provide necessary facilities to facilitate the work of government agencies in the district. Banks are required to display a signboard indicating the name of the lead bank and a separate board explaining the scheme's objectives and benefits. A copy of the district-wise lead bank notifications is made available at the RBI Regional Office. The lead bank's responsibilities extend beyond the original district and continue even if the bank withdraws from the area. Banks are required to report any changes in their operations or management to the RBI immediately. If a bank decides to withdraw from a district, it must seek approval from the RBI. The RBI can also remove a bank from the list of lead banks if its performance is inadequate. Banks are expected to demonstrate leadership by providing leadership, coordination, and overall support to the lead bank scheme. The RBI may issue a certificate to banks that meet the criteria for being considered lead banks. Banks must adhere to all regulatory requirements set by the RBI and other authorities. The RBI regularly monitors the performance of banks in leading the lead bank scheme and takes appropriate action against non-performing banks. Banks are expected to conduct regular reviews of their business plans to ensure they align with the mission statements of the District Consultative Committee (DCC) and the Lead Bank Scheme. They should also keep their branches open during working hours, adhere to RBI instructions regarding branch closures, and use modern technologies to improve service quality. Banks must strictly follow government policies regarding loans, subsidies, and other benefits. The lead bank should also coordinate with the State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC) and District Consultative Committee (DCC) to address grievances and gather feedback. Banks should also provide facilities to farmers and traders to access government schemes and subsidies. Branches of public sector banks must be physically present in the district where their Head Office is located. Banks are responsible for maintaining good customer service and avoiding fraud, as outlined in the Master Direction on Supervisory and Regulatory Practices (MDSRP).

            "question": "Under what conditions are transferors exempt from the Minimum Holding Period requirement when transferring receivables acquired through factoring?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "Eligible transferors are exempt from the Minimum Holding Period (MHP) requirement when transferring receivables acquired as part of factoring business, provided that the residual maturity of the receivables at the time of transfer does not exceed 90 days, and the transferee conducts a proper credit appraisal of the drawee of the bill before acquiring such receivables.",
            "generated_answer": "When a bank transfers receivables acquired through factoring, it can be relieved of the Minimum Holding Period requirement if the transferee bank has a branch in the same location as the original factoring concern. Additionally, the transfer must occur in the form of an assignment of receivables rather than a bill purchase, and the transferee bank should have the capacity to collect the receivables directly or through its own branches or agents. The transferee bank's legal position must also allow for the assignment or sale of receivables without violating banking regulations. If these conditions are met, the transferee may then assign or sell the receivables without being subject to the Minimum Holding Period. Furthermore, the assignment or sale can be accomplished at any time prior to realization, but not during a default period. No interest should be paid by the original bank to the transferee for assigning or selling the receivables, nor should any commissions be paid to the factoring concerns for their role in facilitating the assignment or sale. The original bank should ensure that the transferee has the necessary arrangements to collect the amounts due. If the transferee does not have collection facilities, the original bank should use its own collections or arrange agency collection services. A fee cannot be charged to the borrower by the factoring concern for this agency service. The transfer price of the receivables should reflect market prices and not be influenced by the original factoring firm. The assignment or sale should be treated as a capital transaction, and specific reserve accounts should be created to cover possible losses from uncollectible accounts. The original bank should closely monitor the performance of the assigned receivables and take appropriate action if the quality deteriorates. Any losses resulting from uncollectible accounts should be expensed and not capitalized. If the original bank remains responsible for the bad debts, the receivables should be classified as standard. The transfer should be treated as a change in accounting estimate for tax purposes, and tax implications should be carefully considered. The original bank's balance sheet should be adjusted to reflect the sale of receivables, and appropriate disclosures should be made in the notes to accounts. The sale should be properly recorded in the cash books of both the original and transferee banks, ensuring that no double counting occurs. The assignment should be considered a true sale, and not a financial accommodation or loan to the transferee. The transferee bank should obtain independent legal advice to confirm that the sale is not subject to restrictions, such as non-compete clauses or restrictive covenants, that would prevent the sale from being recognized as a true sale. The terms of the agreement should not include provisions that would tie up the assets of the transferee, making them unavailable for collection. The sale should be completed within 60 days after the receipt of funds from the buyer. The transferee bank should also ensure that the transferor bank provides evidence of valid assignment or sale of receivables, including all required documents, before accepting the transferred receivables. The transferee bank should verify that the original bank has fully complied with regulatory requirements before considering the transfer complete. The original bank should also provide all relevant details about the transfer to the transferee, including the identity of the buyer, the date of the assignment or sale, the amount and dates of payment received, details of the original factoring agreement, and any restrictions placed on the resale of the receivables. If the transfer is part of a larger package of assets, the original bank must clearly identify each receivable for which it is providing a guarantee of indemnity against loss. The original bank should ensure that all liabilities arising from the assignment or sale are adequately disclosed in the notes to the accounts. The original bank should not include the cost of collection or any other expenses incurred in the valuation of the receivables sold, and the value of the receivables should not be inflated. The original bank should also not charge interest on the receivables sold to the transferee. The original bank should keep a copy of the agreement with the buyer for record-keeping purposes. The agreement should be signed by the principal officer of the original bank and the buyer, and it should confirm that the sale is a true sale, not a finance facility. The agreement should state that the sale is free from any restrictions that would impede the collection of the receivables. The agreement should also specify that the transferee bank will be liable to the original bank only if the buyer fails to make payment, and the original bank will have a right to claim compensation from the buyer for any damage caused by the failure to make payment. The agreement should indicate that the seller bears all risks associated with the sale and acknowledges its responsibility for proper valuation of the receivables, their sale, and the impact on the income statement. The agreement should state that the sale is not a loan or finance facility from the original bank to the transferee. The agreement should indicate that the transferee bank will continue to bear the risk of loss from uncollectible accounts, and the original bank will not be required to",

            "question": "How does the minimum number of professional staff required for an audit firm vary based on the asset size of the State Co-operative Bank or Central Co-operative Bank being audited?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "The minimum number of professional staff required for an audit firm depends on the asset size of the State Co-operative Bank (StCB) or Central Co-operative Bank (CCB) being audited; for banks with assets above \u20b915,000 crore, a minimum of 8 professional staff are required; for banks with assets above \u20b91,000 crore and up to \u20b915,000 crore, a minimum of 4 are required; and for banks with assets up to \u20b91,000 crore, a minimum of 2 are required.",
            "generated_answer": "For banks with an asset size of \u20b95,000 crore and above, an audit firm needs at least five professional staff. For banks with an asset size between \u20b93,000 crore and less than \u20b95,000 crore, three professional staff are required. And for banks with an asset size of \u20b93,000 crore and below, two professional staff are required. This includes one Chartered Accountant (CA) member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), unless otherwise specified. The specific requirements regarding CA members may be different from this general guideline. Additionally, one Statutory Auditor of the bank should also be considered as part of the minimum staff requirement, but this can be shared among multiple firms. The requirement for Statutory Auditors varies by jurisdiction. For example, banks in Gujarat require one Statutory Auditor, while banks in Jammu & Kashmir need two Statutory Auditors. These requirements are applicable even when a single firm handles both the statutory and financial audits. The requirement for Statutory Auditors is determined by the relevant regulatory authority, such as the Department of Supervision, RBI, or the Reserve Bank of India (J&K) Act, 2019. In cases where no Statutory Auditor is appointed, the bank's management should explain why. If no Statutory Auditor is present during an inspection, it is treated as a deficiency. When a single firm conducts both the statutory and financial audits, the requirement for a Statutory Auditor is considered fulfilled. The number of professional staff includes all partners and associates, but does not include those with clerical responsibilities. The definition of a professional staff member includes individuals who possess qualifications from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), including Chartered Accountants (CAs), Cost Accountants (CAs), Company Secretaries (CSs), and Chartered Financial Analysts (CFAs). The same qualifications must be held by at least one professional staff member in each of these categories. The professional staff also includes individuals who are eligible to be appointed as Statutory Auditors of the bank and have completed the statutory training of at least one year under a partner or associate of a firm that has been appointed as the Statutory Auditor. The professional staff should hold certificates issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, including Chartered Accountants (CAs), Cost Accountants (CAs), Company Secretaries (CSs), and Chartered Financial Analysts (CFAs).

            "ground_truth_answer": "The Al-Qaida Sanctions List includes measures such as assets freeze, travel ban and arms embargo.",
            "generated_answer": "The Al-Qaida Sanctions List includes individuals and entities subject to an assets freeze and travel ban. This means their assets cannot be transferred, received, possessed, controlled, or discharged in any way. They are also prohibited from engaging in certain transactions, and their passports or visas may be temporarily withheld or revoked by countries where they reside or transit. Additionally, they are subject to an arms embargo, preventing the supply, sale, transfer, or provision of specified weapons systems, including those used for internal security purposes, to Afghanistan. The list is reviewed regularly by the UN Security Council. Individuals and entities found violating these measures face sanctions, potentially including assets freezes, travel bans, and arms embargoes. The full impact of these measures is dependent on country-specific implementation. If you suspect violations, report them to the Ombudsperson appointed by the United Nations Secretary-General. The United States also has similar sanctions measures under its own laws. The EU maintains a consolidated list of those subject to sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans, and applies an arms embargo. Non-EU individuals or entities can seek authorization from the European External Action Service for 'humanitarian exceptions'. The G-7 also imposes sanctions, primarily relating to financial sanctions and arms embargoes. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) lists individuals and entities subject to sanctions due to their involvement in prohibited activities. These measures are applied through the entry of relevant UNSC resolutions into force. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) lists individuals and entities subject to sanctions due to their association with Al-Qaida, Taliban, and associated groups. The FATF publishes a consolidated list. Individuals and entities suspected of violating FATF recommendations face sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) may impose sanctions, such as asset freezes and travel bans, against individuals who have committed serious violations of international humanitarian law. The ICJ may also issue arrest warrants. The ICC also imposes sanctions, including travel bans and arms embargoes, on individuals suspected of serious crimes. The ICC's list is published on its website. The International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) provides alerts concerning individuals subject to wanted notices. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) provides lists of individuals facing severe risks due to persecution or conflict.

            "question": "What are the guidelines for Scheduled Commercial Banks regarding setting borrowing limits in the Call and Notice Money Markets?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding small finance banks and payment banks) can establish their own borrowing limits in the Call and Notice Money Markets, provided they adhere to internal board-approved limits and the prudential limits for inter-bank liabilities set by the Department of Regulation.",
            "generated_answer": "Scheduled Commercial Banks should establish internal guidelines that reflect prudent credit standards when setting borrowing limits in the Call and Notice Money Markets. These guidelines should be approved by the bank's Board of Directors and reviewed regularly. The lending policies for these markets should be clearly defined, considering factors like the maturity of the borrowing, the bank's exposure, the borrower's capacity to service the borrowed amount, and the risk weight assigned to the borrowed amounts under regulatory capital requirements. Senior management must monitor compliance with these guidelines at all times. The guidelines should also be communicated to branches, and adherence should be monitored through internal audits. If an exception requires approval from senior management, it should be documented and approved separately, with the specific reasons for non-compliance outlined in the application. Borrowing limits should be adjusted periodically based on changes in market conditions and the bank's credit policies. Limits exceeding \u20b95 crore should require separate approval from the Head Office. The borrowing limit should be used for short-term working capital needs, not long-term fund generation, and not for inter-bank advances. Branches may issue short-term credits up to the limit for the purpose of clearing inter-branch or inter-office dues, but this is considered part of working capital. Funds not needed for working capital should be placed in savings accounts or current accounts. The maximum borrowing limit for any single borrower should be 10% of the bank's total loans and advances, considering existing exposures, commitments, and credit facilities available to the borrower. For borrowers without existing credit facilities, the borrowing limit should not exceed \u20b950 lakh, unless sanctioned by the bank's Board of Directors. Exemptions can be granted for certain government-related transactions. A borrower should not be allowed to borrow from both the inter-bank and stock markets simultaneously for the same purpose, nor should they borrow from multiple banks using the same source of funds. Banks must ensure they have sufficient liquidity to meet their obligations and should avoid relying excessively on inter-bank borrowings for funding their working capital needs. Inter-bank advances should not be used for long-term fund generation or to fund inter-office or inter-branch dues. Banks should establish a proper system for monitoring and controlling inter-bank advances, ensuring that their level remains within prudent limits. Inter-bank advances should not exceed 40% of the total advances outstanding and should be proportional to the size of the bank's business and its liquidity position. A significant rise in inter-bank advances should be treated as a signal of potential problems and require careful review by the bank's Board of Directors. In cases where inter-bank advances are higher than 40% of total advances, the bank's Board of Directors should review the entire credit policy and consider imposing a ceiling on inter-bank advances. Banks should avoid inter-bank advances from money lenders or other unsecured sources. They should also avoid providing overdraft facilities or inter-bank advances beyond their sanctioned limits to customers who are already overdrawn in their current accounts. Loans obtained by directors, directors' relatives, or associates should be treated as 'other resources', not as funds raised from the bank. Expenditure on inter-bank advances should be fully disclosed in the income statement as a deduction from gross profit. Banks should adhere to the prescribed guidelines for raising funds through inter-bank advances and ensure timely repayment of such advances. Disproportionate advances, especially to senior officials, should be avoided, and the frequency of renewals should be closely monitored. A bank's ability to renew inter-bank advances should not be influenced by the availability of funds. Overdue inter-bank advances should be promptly classified as a loss and written off if they cannot be recovered. Banks should avoid issuing inter-bank advances against accommodation bills drawn by them and should not issue drafts to settle inter-bank advances. Inter-bank advances should not be used to raise funds for long-term financing. Banks should not use the profits made on inter-bank advances to subsidize other loans or financial services. The profit motive should prevail in all dealings. Banks should exercise caution in granting inter-bank advances to joint stock companies with existing financial institutions, considering the nature and extent of their existing borrowing facilities. A significant increase in inter-bank advances should prompt a review of the bank's credit policy. Banks should avoid granting advances to subsidiaries or affiliated concerns for inter-bank purposes. Banks should also avoid granting advances to moneylenders or other unsecured sources for inter-bank purposes. Banks should not grant inter-bank advances against accommodation bills drawn by them or to members of their own group for inter-bank purposes. Banks should not grant overdraft facilities or inter-bank advances beyond their sanctioned limits to customers who are already overdrawn in their current accounts.

This includes Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding Small Finance Banks), Regional Rural Banks, State Cooperative Banks, Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs), and Small Finance Banks that have been in existence for more than three years. However, it does not apply to Foreign Banks' Subsidiaries. Scheduled Primary (Cooperative) Banks that do not hold a certificate of audited accounts are also subject to this requirement. Banks that do not meet the minimum balance requirements may be required to maintain higher CRR. Banks can request adjustments in their CRR at quarterly intervals from the Reserve Bank of India. If there is an excess of unutilized funds, banks must submit them to the Reserve Bank of India for credit to their accounts or investment in specified securities. Banks that borrow from the Reserve Bank of India under the Lending to Private Sector Scheme (LTPS) are exempt from this requirement. The rate of CRR varies depending on the bank's tier. Banks must pay interest on unutilized CRR to the Reserve Bank of India and vice versa. A penalty is charged if funds are not returned within the stipulated time frame. The penal interest rate is determined by the Reserve Bank of India based on prevailing interest rates. These instructions replace previous guidelines regarding CRR. Banks must adhere to these instructions as amended by the Reserve Bank of India and issue necessary instructions to their branches. Non-bank financial companies (NBFCs) like Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) are currently exempt from this requirement. However, if they meet the criteria for being classified as banks, they will be required to comply with the CRR norms. The Reserve Bank of India has also introduced a Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) mechanism to address liquidity management issues beyond the scope of CRR. The LAF mechanism allows banks to manage excess or shortage of reserves without requiring cash deposits. Banks must submit details of their cash balance position to the RBI daily, including the amount of unutilized CRR, and report changes to the Statutory Auditor for verification. The LAF mechanism applies to both statutory and non-statutory reserves. Banks are required to reconcile their cash balance positions with the RBI daily. The policy of maintaining CRR is expected to continue. The LAF mechanism is now available to banks other than Small Finance Banks (SFBs). The reserve requirements for Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) are reviewed and updated annually. The CRR requirement for SFBs remains unchanged. The circular also updates the methodology for calculating the CRR requirement for foreign banks' subsidiaries.

These courses must be specified in gazette notification no. SO 2374(E) dated May 23, 2022.",
            "generated_answer": "Authorised Persons can facilitate remittances to foreign universities or institutions for payment of fees for courses leading to a degree or diploma, including those conducted by foreign universities in India within the Central or State Government's Institutes of National Importance. They can also remit money for payment of examination fees to foreign universities, provided the applicant holds a valid Indian passport and is studying abroad through a recognized institution under the government's scheme. Additionally, remittances are permitted for payment of fees at private foreign universities and institutions in IFSCs, excluding those providing vocational courses like computer science and engineering, for higher education. The limit is \u20b910 lakh per individual for the academic year 2024-25 onwards. For students returning from overseas, remittances for up to \u20b95 lakh are permitted within 90 days of their return to India, allowing them to pay tuition fees and provide living expenses during the first two years of their course. Remittances for payment of fees to foreign universities or institutions in IFSCs are not considered for the 'Foreign Tour of India' under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). If remittances exceed this limit, the excess amount can be remitted after completing the course, provided the applicant repatriates the funds as per the 'Repayment of Scholarships and Fellowships Scheme'. The maximum amount that can be remitted under the FRCS is \u20b910 lakh per individual for each academic year, subject to approval from the Department of Higher Education, MHRD, and verified by the university. The remittance of these amounts is governed by FEMA regulations. The Foreign Tour of India (FTOI) eligibility is determined based on the FMO issued by the university. The FMO should have a clear and distinct clause stating that any excess amount exceeding the prescribed limit can be repaid from the Scholarship/Fellowship within 90 days of arrival in India. The FMO should also indicate the mode of repayment and state whether the full amount must be repaid or only the excess amount. Any amount exceeding \u20b95 lakh must be repaid within 30 days of completing the course, and the repayment must be made through a bank account registered with the Department of Higher Education, MHRD. Excess amounts must be repaid in full before applying for further scholarships, unless approved by the Ministry of HRD. Banks must obtain a copy of the relevant clauses from the universities when facilitating these remittances. For overseas branches of Indian Universities, the limit for remitting fees is \u20b910 lakh per student for each academic year, while for other institutions, it is \u20b95 lakh. These limits apply to both current and prospective students. Banks are required to obtain an authorization certificate from the respective University/Institute from the DPEHSR website when facilitating these remittances. If a student leaves the course midway, banks must stop all further remittances until the outstanding dues are cleared. No remittance is allowed beyond 90 days from admission, except for cases where the student has been granted permission to study abroad under government schemes. Banks must ensure compliance with these instructions and report breaches to the Department of External Affairs. The process for obtaining authorization certificates will be determined by the Reserve Bank of India and the Department of Higher Education, MHRD. The Reserve Bank of India has advised banks to obtain separate authorization certificates for each student for fee payments, if necessary. Banks are advised to establish a database of institutions eligible for fee remittances and use it to verify the eligibility of applicants. Fees for distance learning courses offered by foreign universities are not eligible for remittance. Remittances to UK universities for postgraduate studies are restricted to the payment of fees for courses leading to a degree or diploma.

Banks are also prohibited from facilitating remittances to individuals who are already resident in foreign countries for full-time higher education and cannot return to India. Banks must verify the authenticity of the application and provide copies of the authorization certificate to the applicants.

For deposits with a maturity of 3 years and above, up to 5 years, the ceiling is Overnight ARR plus 350 basis points.",
            "generated_answer": "For fresh Foreign Currency Non-Resident (Bank) [FCNR(B)] deposits, the interest rate ceiling is based on the Overnight Alternative Reference Rate (ARR) for the respective currency/swap plus 300 basis points. The Overnight ARR is published by the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) Clearing Corporation Limited (IFSCCL). If the Overnight ARR is not available, the bank may use the one-day or two-day swap rate published by the ICE Futures Europe Limited, London, as an alternative. The swap rates must be at least three months tenor. The ceiling also includes a spread of 50 basis points for deposits of Rs.1 crore and above. This ceiling applies to all new FCNR(B) deposits opened from time to time until notified otherwise. The effective date of this notification is March 31, 2024.

            "ground_truth_answer": "Authorised Dealer Category-I banks can permit Qualified Jewellers to make advance payments for up to eleven days for silver imports through the India International Bullion Exchange (IIBX).",
            "generated_answer": "Authorised Dealers (AD banks), including Category-I AD banks, can authorize Qualified Jewellers to remit advance payments up to \u20b95 crore for the purchase of silver from the India International Bullion Exchange (IIBX) within a single calendar year, allowing for multiple transactions. The authorized period for these advance payments is twelve months from the date of authorization. For example, if an authorization is issued on April 1, 2024, it would allow for advance payment up to June 30, 2024, for the purchase of silver from IIBX during that year. This authorization is valid until March 31 of the following year. If no further authorization is sought before this date, the previous authorization lapses. For subsequent years, the process is repeated. However, this mechanism does not apply to payments made in gold, whether in bullion or ingots. Any advance payment exceeding \u20b95 crore must be funded by credit limits allocated by AD banks. Payments exceeding \u20b95 crore are subject to specific guidelines outlined in paragraph 3 of this circular. Payments below \u20b95 crore may be funded from existing Credit Limits or new credit limits sanctioned by AD banks for the jeweller, subject to compliance with regulatory guidelines regarding credit limits and exposure norms for jewellery business. Payments above \u20b95 crore require separate authorization from the Reserve Bank of India. All payments must adhere to the provisions of Section 9 of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999.

            "question": "What is the incremental Cash Reserve Ratio (I-CRR) and what is its purpose in the Indian banking system?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "The incremental Cash Reserve Ratio (I-CRR) is an additional reserve requirement imposed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on specific banks, mandating them to maintain a certain percentage of the increase in their Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) with the RBI. This is over and above the existing Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) requirement. The I-CRR is a tool used by the RBI to manage liquidity in the banking system.",
            "generated_answer": "The incremental Cash Reserve Ratio (I-CRR) is a measure introduced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that calculates the increase in a bank's cash reserves relative to its increase in net demand and time liabilities. It aims to ensure banks maintain sufficient liquidity and prevent excess credit expansion. The I-CRR is applied to the portion of the increase in a bank's net demand and time liabilities that exceeds 5 percent of its average daily balance during the previous fortnight. Banks are required to hold 3 percent of this incremental amount as CRR. The specific incremental CRR rate varies depending on the bank's Tier classification. For example, Tier 1 banks have an incremental CRR of 8.25 percent, while Tier 4 banks have an incremental CRR of 10.25 percent. For all other banks, the incremental CRR is 9 percent. A negative CRR is not permitted. The incremental CRR is calculated separately for each bank using their respective figures. A zero CRR means no incremental Cash Reserve Ratio applies to a bank. Banks must submit data regarding incremental CRR calculations through their Head Office to the Reserve Bank. The incremental CRR is not applicable to inter-bank advances or advances to government undertakings held under bank's own name. It is also not applicable to capital funds, fund-based deposits, or long-term borrowings from financial institutions like the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). The calculation of I-CRR includes capital funds held by banks under their own names and inter-bank deposits. However, inter-bank advances are excluded. If a bank's cash reserve falls short of the calculated incremental CRR, it must obtain additional funds from the RBI. The incremental CRR is computed in the same manner for both rupee and foreign currency accounts, but exchange differences arising from fluctuations in the exchange rate are not included when calculating the incremental CRR. The incremental CRR on fresh rupee advances is computed on a daily basis and credited to the bank's cash balance at the close of business of the next day. Banks are expected to remit the incremental CRR due to the RBI within two calendar days from the next day following the calculation. For foreign currency transactions, the incremental CRR is calculated on a quarterly basis and remitted within two calendar days from the next day following the calculation. Excess remittance to the RBI must be adjusted against future payments, while excess CRR received from the RBI must be returned. The incremental CRR can be waived for banks experiencing difficulties due to economic conditions. Banks must report details of waiver of incremental CRR to the Departmental Control Room (DCR) at the RBI, including reasons for non-remission or late remission, along with a copy of the relevant minutes from the Board of Directors' meeting. Banks are not allowed to reduce their existing Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) by remitting incremental CRR to the RBI. The incremental CRR applies to all new loans and investments made by the bank after the date of notification. Banks are required to continue remitting the incremental CRR even if they subsequently reduce their existing CRR below 3 percent. The incremental CRR does not apply to inter-bank advances or advances to government undertakings held under the bank's own name. The calculation excludes capital funds held by the bank under its own name and inter-bank deposits. The incremental CRR is computed separately for each bank using their respective figures. A zero CRR means no incremental Cash Reserve Ratio applies to the bank. If a bank's cash reserves fall short of the calculated incremental CRR, they must obtain additional funds from the RBI.

            "question": "What are the key changes introduced by the amendment of capital adequacy guidelines regarding the trading book and AFS-reserve?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "The amendment of capital adequacy guidelines introduces the 'Held for Trading (HFT)' accounting sub-classification and AFS-reserve as part of regulatory capital, aligning with the Master Direction on Investment.",
            "generated_answer": "The amendment introduces a new definition of 'trading book' under regulatory capital requirements, aligning with the revised definitions in the Master Direction on Investment. It also reclassifies investments previously categorized as 'Other Financial Assets - Held for Trading' back into the 'Assets \u2013 Other Tier 1 Capital \u2013 AFS-reserve'. The total amount of these 'AFS-reserve' assets will be netted against equity, resulting in an increase in equity capital. This allows banks to maintain their existing capital position, while still adhering to the revised definition of 'trading book'. The amendments to the Master Direction on Investment are effective from April 1, 2024, but the revision in the Master Direction on Capital Adequacy requires approval from the RBI's Board of Directors. The revised Master Direction on Capital Adequacy will be effective after the Board approves the amendments. Banks must comply with both the revised definitions of 'trading book' and the revised Master Direction on Capital Adequacy by April 1, 2024, and apply the revised definitions immediately in their Financial Statements for the quarter ending March 31, 2024. However, the revised Master Direction on Capital Adequacy will remain applicable only for the financial year ending March 31, 2024, and banks may continue to prepare their Financial Statements as per the previous Master Direction on Capital Adequacy. The revised Master Direction on Capital Adequacy will be effective from April 1, 2024, when it will be applied to capital adequacy assessments for the financial year starting from April 1, 2024. The netting of AFS-reserve against equity is effective from April 1, 2024. Banks must submit their compliance status to the Department of Regulation (DoR) of RBI by June 30, 2024. The amendment also addresses changes in the reporting format for exposure data under the Capital Management Information System (CMIS). Banks are required to report exposure data in two formats: one according to the current Master Direction on Capital Adequacy and another according to the revised Master Direction on Capital Adequacy. The reporting period for exposure data will be extended to cover the quarter ending March 31, 2024, and the first half of the financial year beginning April 1, 2024. The reporting format for risk weights will be updated accordingly. The new reporting format includes fields such as maturity, coupon, accrual status, and whether the exposure is eligible for netting. Banks must submit the revised reports to the Department of Regulation (DoR) of RBI through the CMIS portal. The existing Master Direction on Investment remains in effect until further notice. The guidelines regarding the scope of netting of receivables are aligned with the revised Master Direction on Capital Adequacy. The guidance on valuation of securitisation exposures is aligned with the provisions of the Master Direction on Banking Business \u2013 Securitization and Exposures, as amended. The definition of 'other financial assets held for investment purposes' has been expanded to align with the revised Master Direction on Investment. The definition of 'trading book' now includes all transactions where the bank intends to dispose of the underlying security within twelve months of purchase. The definition of 'on-balance sheet exposure' under the revised Master Direction on Capital Adequacy now includes off-balance sheet items like guarantees and credit derivatives. The definition of 'on-balance sheet exposure' under the revised Master Direction on Capital Adequacy excludes derivative contracts with no maturity date and those that mature within twelve months from the reporting date. The definition of 'on-balance sheet exposure' under the revised Master Direction on Capital Adequacy excludes securitised exposures with residual maturities of twelve months or more. The definition of 'non-performing asset' under the revised Master Direction on Capital Adequacy includes exposures where payments have stopped due to restructuring and are not classified as 'standard'. The definition of 'non-performing asset' under the revised Master Direction on Capital Adequacy excludes securitised exposures where payments have stopped due to restructuring and are not classified as 'standard'. The Master Direction on Capital Adequacy now defines 'capital adequacy' as the minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to Total Risk-Weighted Assets, as per paragraph 7.1.1 of the revised Master Direction on Capital Adequacy. The definition of 'non-performing asset' under the revised Master Direction on Capital Adequacy excludes securitised exposures where payments have stopped due to restructuring and are not classified as 'standard'.

            "generated_answer": "Card issuing banks can enable Card-on-File (CoFT) token generation through their mobile applications, internet banking, or standalone CoFT management systems. To generate tokens, customers must provide explicit consent through an affirmative action, such as clicking 'Allow', and authenticate themselves using multi-factor authentication methods like biometric data, one-time passwords (OTP), fingerprint recognition, iris scan, or facial recognition. The generated tokens are valid for a specified time period. The bank's policies should ensure that the token expiration aligns with the merchant's checkout time frame. Banks are also required to provide an option to disable the CoFT feature on the customer's account within the mobile application. For transactions where customer authentication is already performed during checkout, banks may use existing customer authentication mechanisms to facilitate CoFT token generation. Banks should also allow customers to revoke CoFT tokens associated with specific merchants. A separate process must be established to remove tokens generated for specific merchants from a customer's account due to fraud or suspicious activity, ensuring proper identification. Banks must maintain records of all transactions associated with the CoFT token, including timestamps of token generation, expiry dates, usage, and revocation dates.

            "question": "Which bank is designated as the lead bank for the Soreng district in Sikkim?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "The State Bank of India has been assigned the lead bank responsibility for the newly formed Soreng district in Sikkim.",
            "generated_answer": "The State Bank of India has been assigned the lead bank responsibility for the newly formed Soreng district in Sikkim. This designation aligns with the instructions provided by the Reserve Bank of India regarding the assignment of lead banks to various districts within the state. The lead bank's role includes coordinating credit flow, developmental activities, and financial inclusion initiatives in the assigned district. As part of this mandate, the bank conducts an annual review of its performance in the district and submits a report to the Department of Rural Development, Government of India, detailing the progress made in achieving credit targets and other relevant financial services. The lead bank also participates in a quarterly review meeting organized by the RBI, where progress against targets set during the previous quarter and the current quarter is discussed. The final report is then submitted to the Reserve Bank of India, Regional Office, Kolkata. The lead bank is also responsible for initiating efforts to establish a Credit Information Company in the district, which is crucial for enhancing the efficiency of credit assessment and management practices. Additionally, the lead bank coordinates with all agencies involved in the district's development and serves as a conduit for communication between them and the central and state governments. It also coordinates with financial institutions like commercial banks and insurance companies to enhance credit flow to priority sectors. Finally, the lead bank assists in coordinating the implementation of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) in the district. The lead bank system provides a mechanism for the government to coordinate the efforts of different financial institutions towards the overall socio-economic development of the district. Sikkim's unique geographical features, such as high altitude and extreme weather conditions, have necessitated a special approach to credit flow and financial inclusion. Therefore, the lead bank system in Sikkim addresses these challenges by leveraging the strengths of public-private partnerships, community-based organizations, and existing credit linkages through specialized agencies to facilitate effective credit flow to priority sectors. The lead bank is required to conduct a thorough review of the district's credit potential and take necessary corrective measures to improve the credit flow to the identified priority sectors. This comprehensive approach ensures that the district's development needs are adequately addressed, promoting sustainable economic growth and improving the quality of life for the people residing there. The lead bank system in Sikkim has proven to be instrumental in achieving these objectives, facilitating the effective implementation of government policies and programs aimed at rural development and poverty reduction. The district-wise list of lead banks is periodically updated based on changes in administrative boundaries and financial inclusion needs. For example, the lead bank for the Garur district was initially assigned to the Punjab National Bank, but was later transferred to the State Bank of India due to the merger of the Garur and Soreng districts. The State Bank of India now serves both districts. The list is subject to change as the Sikkim government continues to reorganize its administrative structure. The State Bank of India's appointment as the lead bank for the Soreng district signifies its commitment to supporting the economic and social development of the region. This designation underscores the importance of effective coordination and collaboration among various stakeholders in achieving the district's development goals. The appointment also reflects the RBI's approach to promoting financial inclusion and economic growth in rural areas. The lead bank's responsibilities extend beyond credit provision, encompassing coordination of developmental activities and financial inclusion initiatives. The appointment of a lead bank is therefore a significant step towards improving the overall well-being of the people in the Soreng district. The process involves detailed planning and strategic execution to ensure maximum impact from the allocated resources. The lead bank system in Sikkim is designed to foster collaboration among various agencies involved in the district's development, including banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions. This collaborative approach enhances the effectiveness of credit flow and financial inclusion initiatives, ultimately contributing to the district's socio-economic progress. The lead bank plays a pivotal role in coordinating these efforts, ensuring that the district's development needs are adequately addressed. The lead bank system also facilitates the implementation of government programs and policies related to rural development and poverty reduction. The RBI regularly reviews the performance of lead banks and their appointed districts to ensure effective implementation of credit flow and financial inclusion strategies. The lead bank system has been successful in addressing the unique challenges faced by Sikkim, including its mountainous terrain and extreme weather conditions, by promoting coordinated efforts among various stakeholders. The designation of the State Bank of India as the lead bank for the Soreng district represents a commitment to improving the district's economic prospects and quality of life for its residents. The lead bank's responsibilities encompass credit flow coordination, financial inclusion initiatives, and the coordination of various developmental activities in the district. The appointment of a lead bank is a critical component of the overall strategy for the district's development. The lead bank system in Sikkim has proven to be effective in promoting credit flow to priority sectors and enhancing financial inclusion in the district. The district-wise list of lead banks is periodically reviewed and updated based on administrative changes and evolving development needs.

            "question": "What are the key updates regarding the reporting of OTC foreign exchange derivative contracts and foreign currency interest rate derivative contracts in the amendments to the Master Direction on Risk Management and Inter-Bank Dealings?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "The amendments to the Master Direction on Risk Management and Inter-Bank Dealings include updates to the reporting of OTC foreign exchange derivative contracts and foreign currency interest rate derivative contracts to the Trade Repository of Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. These updates also encompass changes to the reporting format, mode, and timelines.",
            "generated_answer": "The amendments update the reporting format for OTC foreign exchange derivative contracts and foreign currency interest rate derivative contracts to align with the new Master Direction on Risk Management and Inter-Bank Dealings. The scope of reporting has been expanded to include all non-standardised OTC foreign exchange derivatives and foreign currency interest rate derivatives held by banks in their trading book, as well as standardised foreign exchange derivatives and foreign currency interest rate derivatives. Banks must also report these transactions on the day they occur, regardless of whether a trade repository has been established. The submission window for these transactions is now from 18:00 hours onwards to 23:59 hours. Additionally, banks are required to submit their current stock position of these derivatives daily. The reporting template for OTC foreign exchange derivatives has been updated to reflect the changes in the Master Direction, and the same applies to foreign currency interest rate derivatives. For instance, data pertaining to 'notional amount outstanding' has been split into two columns: one for OTC FX derivatives (under Gilt-11) and another for FX futures and options (under Gilt-17). The reporting template for foreign currency interest rate derivatives remains the same. An additional column has been introduced in the existing template for 'notional amount outstanding' for these derivatives. A separate column is also available in Annex III of the Master Direction for reporting OTC derivatives held in the trading book. The amended reporting template for OTC derivatives is available at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eZtJ4l2nE6Yx6dN0v7KwDvGmFjgOaBZ00y1XuLrAqP4/edit. The reporting window for these transactions is from 18:00 hours to 23:59 hours, and banks should continue to submit their consolidated current stock position of these derivatives daily. The consolidated stock position of the OTC derivatives held by subsidiaries, including those from the foreign jurisdiction where the subsidiary is incorporated, must be submitted along with the consolidated position of the head office. If a bank does not have any OTC derivatives outstanding in any of its subsidiaries, they need not submit a separate statement. The reporting template and instructions remain unchanged from the previous circular. The submission window for these transactions is from 18:00 hours onwards to 23:59 hours.

            "question": "What support should currency chest holding branches extend regarding \u20b92000 notes, and what recourse do banks have if they encounter cash difficulties?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "Branches holding currency chests should provide support to linked and non-linked branches by accepting \u20b92000 notes and distributing banknotes of other denominations. Banks can contact the RBI Issue Office if they face difficulties obtaining cash.",
            "generated_answer": "Currency chest holding branches should provide support by accommodating customers' needs for \u20b92000 notes at their counters and in branches. If cash difficulties arise due to insufficient stock from the Currency Chest, these branches can seek assistance from other branches holding stock of \u20b92000 notes. Banks should also keep a minimum of \u20b91.5 crore in \u20b92000 notes in each Currency Chest to address potential difficulties. The Reserve Bank of India has instructed that there will be no reduction in clearing house liabilities for banks unable to meet requests due to stock shortages from Currency Chests. For transactions occurring before the opening of Currency Chests, banks should maintain a stock of \u20b92000 notes equivalent to at least 3 days of expected demand. Banks should also avoid breaking large bills into smaller ones when issuing \u20b92000 notes. Branches should record the number of \u20b92000 notes exchanged daily, and if insufficient stock is available, they should inform the Currency Chest branch and reserve space for incoming stock. The bank's controller should ensure adequate stocks are maintained at Currency Chests. Additionally, branches should keep an account of stock balances and regularly communicate this information to the Head Office of the bank, the Reserve Bank of India, and the nearest Regional Office of RBI. Banks should also report any incidents of violence or theft affecting Currency Chests to the nearest Regional Office of RBI. The Centralized Cash Management System (CCMS) should provide a solution for banks without Currency Chest facilities to manage their currency requirements. Finally, banks should report details of outstanding stock of \u20b92000 notes and requests for exchange to the Reserve Bank of India on a daily basis through their Lead Branch. The Reserve Bank of India may consider providing additional facilities to facilitate the exchange of these notes. The Reserve Bank of India may also consider allowing banks to issue \u20b92000 notes without reporting them to the Currency Chest, similar to the process for \u20b91000 notes issued during demonetization. Banks should report any delays in processing such applications to the Reserve Bank of India. Banks should also take measures to prevent the hoarding of \u20b92000 notes, ensuring they are circulated as widely as possible. Banks should conduct staff training and awareness campaigns to educate customers about the importance of using \u20b92000 notes, particularly for older customers. Banks must adhere to the guidelines regarding the safe custody and transportation of \u20b92000 notes, as well as the reporting of suspected counterfeit \u20b92000 notes to the relevant authorities. Banks should also adhere to the procedure for exchanging \u20b92000 notes with \u20b9500 and \u20b91000 notes, as described in the Master Circular on Demonetisation dated October 8, 2016.

This includes submitting a Board-approved Action Plan for reducing its Net NPAs below the Risk Threshold 1.",
            "generated_answer": "When a bank is placed under PCA, the RBI may require the bank to undertake specific actions related to reducing Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), including initiating necessary legal proceedings against defaulting borrowers and taking measures to improve the credit quality of assets. These measures aim to enhance the bank's asset quality and operational efficiency. The RBI also requires banks to submit detailed action plans for implementing these measures, which are reviewed periodically by the RBI. If a bank fails to meet the targets or demonstrates inadequate performance, it may be subjected to further supervisory measures, including public announcements and restrictions on discretionary powers. Banks may also face a requirement to increase their capital base, which would lead to a downgrade in their credit rating. The RBI has the authority to remove the bank from its list of scheduled commercial banks and close down any branches that have been operating illegally. The removal of a bank from the list could trigger a downgrade in its credit rating, leading to higher interest rates on loans. If a bank becomes insolvent, the RBI can declare it bankrupt, placing it under the supervision of a High Court-appointed Administrator, who will liquidate the bank's assets to pay off creditors. The RBI may also recommend government intervention if a bank's situation worsens significantly. The RBI retains the power to recall bank deposits from depositors due to the bank's insolvency. A bank's failure to meet PCA requirements may result in its removal from the Reserve Bank of India's Master List of Scheduled Commercial Banks. In cases where a bank is considered a Public Sector Bank, the Reserve Bank of India may require other banks to purchase its shares to prevent the bank from becoming a loss-making entity. The RBI can also take over the management of the bank's affairs until the problem is resolved. For banks with significant NPAs, the RBI may consider suspending their lending powers until the bank can demonstrate satisfactory performance. The RBI may also decide to take a 25% stake in the bank. When a bank is removed from the Master List, it is barred from issuing fresh deposits or loans for a period ranging from 30 to 180 days, depending on the severity of the violations. The RBI can also suspend the senior-most promoter director(s) of the bank for up to six months. Finally, if a bank's NPAs continue to rise, the RBI may suspend all new borrowings from the bank, restricting the issuance of long-term bonds or fixed deposits. The RBI may also demand that banks reduce their dividend payouts. The RBI can also seek judicial intervention to close down the bank, remove its directors, and discontinue its operations. The RBI may also implement a moratorium on the issuance of new loans or advances, restrict the bank's credit facilities, and prohibit the bank from making any new commitments. The RBI may also revoke the bank's license to operate, preventing it from engaging in banking activities. The RBI may also impose a moratorium on new loans or advances, restrict existing credit limits, and prohibit the bank from making any new commitments.

            "question": "When banks provide credit to private builders for housing projects, what factors should be considered to ensure fair pricing for the ultimate beneficiaries?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "Banks extending credit to private builders should ensure that the prices charged to the ultimate beneficiaries are based on the documented price of the land, the actual cost of construction, and a reasonable profit margin, without any speculative elements.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks should assess the need for private builders to provide loans based on their track record of completing projects within prescribed timeframes. Additionally, builders should establish transparent pricing structures to avoid overcharging buyers, and banks should verify these pricing structures through proper valuation techniques before extending credit. Builders should also adhere to government-approved land sale agreements and project completion dates when marketing properties. Banks should not extend credit to builders who fail to follow these guidelines. Furthermore, builders must obtain necessary approvals from regulatory authorities before starting construction and adhere to the stipulated completion timelines. If a builder fails to meet these deadlines, banks should consider pausing or terminating credit facilities. Lastly, banks should discourage builders from acquiring land in specified areas and refrain from issuing bank guarantees for land purchase commitments by individuals. These measures help ensure that property prices remain within reasonable limits, benefiting consumers. Banks should also use standard terms and conditions in loan agreements to protect consumer interests, including provisions for termination of contracts if construction is delayed or halted. The Reserve Bank of India may intervene in cases of delayed construction or speculative land purchases. Banks should also obtain necessary permissions from the Reserve Bank of India's Regional Office before proceeding with sanctioned limits for housing projects. Banks are advised to exercise caution in granting credit to private builders for housing projects with a plot price exceeding \u20b910 lakh and to adhere to the instructions regarding mortgage storage of building materials. A dedicated committee at the bank level should oversee the implementation of these guidelines and ensure that all transactions comply with legal requirements and departmental guidelines.

            "question": "How is a 'bulk deposit' defined for different categories of Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs)?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "For Scheduled Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) categorized as Tier 3 and 4 under the revised regulatory framework, a bulk deposit is defined as a single Rupee term deposit of Rupees one crore and above. For all other cooperative banks (i.e., other than Scheduled UCBs in Tier 3 and 4), a bulk deposit is defined as a single Rupee term deposit of Rupees fifteen lakh and above.",
            "generated_answer": "For primary (Urban Co-operative Banks) Category-I UCBs, a bulk deposit is considered to be an amount exceeding Rupees one crore. For Primary (Urban Co-operative) Banks \u2013 Other than Category-I UCBs, a bulk deposit is defined as an amount exceeding Rupees fifteen lakh. For Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), a bulk deposit is defined as an amount exceeding Rupees three crore. The definitions for the other categories follow this pattern: Tier 1 and Tier 2 UCBs have amounts exceeding Rupees five lakh, Tier 3 UCBs have amounts exceeding Rupees one crore, and Tier 4 UCBs have amounts exceeding Rupees fifty lakh. These definitions apply to both individual deposits and single lump sum deposits. Subsequent to this definition, a lump sum deposit exceeding Rupees one crore is also treated as a bulk deposit. A bulk deposit remains valid until the withdrawal date or earlier if the depositor withdraws the deposit before reaching the specified amount. A lump sum deposit exceeding Rupees one crore is treated as a bulk deposit until the withdrawal date or earlier if the depositor withdraws the deposit before reaching the specified amount. However, a lump sum deposit exceeding Rupees one crore cannot be broken down into multiple smaller amounts for purposes of qualifying as a bulk deposit. A bank may allow a customer to break up a bulk deposit into multiple amounts at the time of opening a new bulk deposit account. When determining whether a deposit qualifies as a bulk deposit, the amount to be paid at maturity must be considered, not the actual amount deposited. For example, if a customer deposits Rs.1000 per month, the maturity amount would be Rs.12,000, which would qualify as a bulk deposit. If the customer deposits Rs.1000 per month for two years, the total amount would be Rs.1,20,000, which would also qualify as a bulk deposit. A bulk deposit should not be confused with a term deposit, which is a deposit made for a fixed period. The amount of a bulk deposit must be declared in writing by the depositor to the bank at the time of opening the account. The bank must acknowledge receipt of the declaration in writing and keep it on record. The amount of a bulk deposit can be altered at the time of renewal, provided the revised amount is within the limit and the depositor declares it in writing. The amount of a bulk deposit renewed after maturity is considered a fresh bulk deposit unless the depositor certifies that there has been no prior alteration or premature withdrawal. The amount of a bulk deposit renewed after its maturity is considered a fresh bulk deposit unless the depositor certifies that there has been no prior alteration or premature withdrawal. A bulk deposit can be withdrawn before maturity but only in full, and in installments under specified conditions, subject to availability of funds and payment of applicable penal charges. The penal charges for premature withdrawal of a bulk deposit are the same as those for a normal term deposit. Any premature withdrawal or partial premature withdrawal of a bulk deposit attracts a penal charge of twenty-five percent of the outstanding principal balance until the full amount is paid or the date of redemption, whichever is earlier. The penal charges for premature withdrawals are the same as those applicable to normal term deposits. A partial premature withdrawal of a bulk deposit attracts a penalty of twenty-five percent of the interest earned during the remaining period until the date of redemption, or until the date of premature withdrawal, whichever is earlier. A partial premature withdrawal attracts a penalty of twenty-five percent of the interest earned during the remaining period until the date of redemption, or until the date of premature withdrawal, whichever is earlier. A partial premature withdrawal of a bulk deposit attracts a penalty of twenty-five percent of the interest earned during the remaining period until the date of redemption, or until the date of premature withdrawal, whichever is earlier. A bulk deposit account cannot be converted into a term deposit or vice versa. The amount of a bulk deposit can be reduced through a lump sum withdrawal at least once every year without requiring the depositor's consent, except when the account is closed. For the purpose of defining a bulk deposit, the depositing of gold bullion is considered equivalent to depositing cash. The amount of gold deposited is calculated using the current market price. The current market price refers to the average price of gold on the last trading day of the preceding fortnight, as certified by the National Spot Price Fixing Committee of COMSIL. A bulk deposit may be withdrawn through various modes, including Cheque/Demand Draft/EFT/RTGS/NACH/CMS. Withdrawals from a bulk deposit account may be credited to the depositor's savings/current account, or to another account opened by the depositor with the same bank, or to the nominated beneficiary, subject to certain conditions. The bank must ensure that the depositor's savings/current account balance is sufficient to cover the amount to be paid at maturity, along with any penal charges. The bank must also establish a system to prevent premature withdrawals from bulk",

However, this pre-debit notification is not required for auto-replenishment of FASTag and National Common Mobility Cards (NCMC) when the balance falls below a customer-defined threshold.",
            "generated_answer": "When processing e-mandates, banks must obtain a pre-debit notification from the customer before debiting their account for any transaction. However, this requirement does not apply to auto-replenishment of FASTag and National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) balances, as it would be impractical to obtain such notifications in real-time for these transactions. For other transactions, banks should provide customers with a pre-debit notification option, either through SMS or email, at least 24 hours before the debit occurs. The notification should clearly state the amount that will be debited from the customer's account, the date of debit, and the name of the merchant or service provider involved. Banks should also ensure that the notification is easily accessible to customers, either on their website or through mobile applications. If a customer chooses not to receive a pre-debit notification, they can still opt-out of auto-replenishment services for their FASTag or NCMC account. Banks should display clear instructions and options for customers to manage their auto-replenishment settings within their application or website. When providing this option, banks should use simple language and avoid legal jargon. Additionally, banks are expected to keep detailed records of customer interactions regarding their choice to receive pre-debit notifications or opt out of auto-replenishment for their FASTag or NCMC accounts. A sample pre-debit notification template is provided in Annexure I. Banks should inform customers about the option to modify their auto-replenishment settings, including the method of cancellation and any associated charges, before obtaining a pre-debit notification. Banks should also display a statement indicating that customers have the right to cancel their auto-replenishment subscription and that a fee may be charged if cancellation is requested after a certain period has elapsed since the previous notification. The bank's website or mobile app should prominently display information about customers' auto-replenishment subscriptions, including details of the merchant(s) or service provider(s) to which the subscription is linked, the current balance in the FASTag/NCMC account, and the charges applicable for activating or deactivating auto-replenishment. Banks should also display details of any pending requests for activation or deactivation of auto-replenishment services. Banks should promptly respond to customer queries regarding their auto-replenishment subscriptions and provide necessary assistance. Banks should establish mechanisms to handle disputes arising from auto-replenishment transactions in a fair and expeditious manner, consulting the relevant dispute resolution mechanism established by the respective road authority for their FASTag/NFC system. Banks should also create a process to track and resolve complaints regarding the functioning of auto-replenishment services, maintaining logs of all complaints received, their resolutions, and subsequent escalation to higher authorities as required. Banks should ensure compliance with the Department of Telecommunications (DCT) guidelines regarding SMS credits for e-mandate notifications. The credit for auto-replenishment notifications should occur during the next regular credit cycle for the respective payment gateway operator. Banks should adhere to the Reserve Bank of India's instructions regarding the handling of frauds involving e-commerce merchants, including those using FASTag and NCMC. They should also report any frauds concerning e-commerce merchants to the relevant authorities, following the procedure outlined in the Master Direction \u2013 Payment Systems \u2013 Handling of Fraudulent Transactions.

            "question": "How are weight adjustments applied to priority sector lending in districts with comparatively lower or higher credit flow, and what are the specific thresholds for these adjustments?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "To encourage lending in districts with lower priority sector credit flow and discourage it in districts with higher flow, incremental priority sector credit in identified districts with per capita PSL less than \u20b99,000 will be assigned a higher weight of 125%. Conversely, a lower weight of 90% will be assigned in districts where per capita PSL is greater than \u20b942,000. Districts not listed will maintain a weightage of 100%.",
            "generated_answer": "To address disparities in credit flow, banks may adjust their weights for priority sector lending in districts where credit flow is lower than the average for their respective categories. For districts with less than 10% of the average loan volume, a downward adjustment of 25 percentage points is applied. Conversely, for districts with more than 40% of the average loan volume, an upward adjustment of 25 percentage points is applied. Districts with loan volumes between 10% and 40% of the average do not undergo this adjustment. Banks must submit their calculations regarding these adjustments along with their annual performance report to the Lead Bank/Designated Office of the Reserve Bank of India. If a district's adjusted priority sector lending meets the RBI's prescribed targets, no further adjustment is required. However, if the adjusted priority sector lending does not meet the target, a downward adjustment of 25 percentage points is applied to the total priority sector lending. For each full year that the adjusted priority sector lending is below the target, a further 25 percentage points is deducted. A negative balance resulting from these deductions cannot be offset by positive balances. The final calculation involves subtracting the negative balance (if applicable) from the net upward adjustment. This final net upward adjustment is then multiplied by the actual credit growth in the relevant category during the year to arrive at the net upward adjustment for the priority sector. The final net upward adjustment is capped at 25 percentage points. The net upward adjustment can be applied to either the overall priority sector target or the target for a specific sub-sector, but not both. The net downward adjustment is calculated as the difference between the total priority sector lending and the target amount after applying the net upward adjustment. A negative net downward adjustment is treated as a zero. Banks are also required to maintain separate records of credit flow to agriculture and non-agriculture for calculating the net upward adjustment. The net upward/downward adjustment cannot be reversed from one year to another. Banks should seek approval from their Board of Directors or equivalent governing body before implementing these adjustments. A review of these adjustments will be conducted at various levels of management within banks. Banks must also submit a certified copy of the approved Board resolution to the Reserve Bank of India. The net upward/downward adjustment must be reported separately under Annex H of the Annual Financial Statements. In cases where there is a downward adjustment of 25 percentage points, the net upward/downward adjustment cannot exceed the net downward adjustment due to negative balances. When there is a net downward adjustment, the net downward adjustment cannot exceed the net upward adjustment. The net upward/downward adjustment cannot be reversed from one year to another. Banks are expected to report all adjustments made to the RBI when submitting their annual reports. In instances where a bank fails to meet the target after making adjustments, a deduction of 25 percentage points from its net interest income will be considered as an irregularity. Banks must also furnish details of these adjustments to the Reserve Bank of India in a prescribed format and manner. The reserve bank may also conduct site visits to verify the credit flow to agriculture in selected districts. Any unexplained discrepancies will be treated as a serious irregularity, subject to appropriate disciplinary action. Banks will not be eligible for any award or recognition for achieving the priority sector lending targets unless they have obtained approval from their Board of Directors or equivalent governing body for the net upward/downward adjustment. The net upward/downward adjustment cannot be reversed from one year to another. The net upward/downward adjustment cannot exceed the net downward adjustment due to negative balances.

They must obtain a 'no dues certificate' from existing credit agencies in the area before extending credit. Additionally, banks should adhere to the scales of finance and security guidelines issued by the RBI/NABARD.",
            "generated_answer": "Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) are permitted to provide loans for agricultural activities, but only if they meet specific eligibility criteria. These banks must have a Board-approved policy that includes procedures for assessing borrowers' creditworthiness. The policies should also detail the methods for monitoring and recovering credit, as well as the process for taking corrective action if the bank fails to maintain adequate loan recovery rates. Additionally, UCBs must obtain necessary statutory approvals from their respective State Government or Union Territory Administration before financing agriculture-related activities. While UCBs can engage in agriculture lending, they may not offer loans against crop production guarantees unless specifically authorized by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). All such loans must be backed by collateral or security and reported to the RBI quarterly. UCBs are also prohibited from engaging in inter-urban agriculture lending. For cooperative housing societies, the definition of agriculture extends to activities like bee-keeping, poultry farming, and fisheries. However, cooperative housing societies cannot use government schemes like NABARD Sub-Plan Funds to access agricultural credit, nor can they be eligible for loans against crop production guarantees. UCBs must adhere to guidelines regarding exposure limits and non-performing assets when financing agriculture. For specific definitions of terms used in the circular, refer to Annex I.

            "question": "How are weights adjusted in priority sector lending (PSL) achievement to address regional disparities at the district level?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "To address regional disparities, districts are ranked based on per capita credit flow to the priority sector. Incremental priority sector credit in districts with comparatively lower credit flow (per capita PSL less than \u20b99,000) will be assigned a higher weight of 125%. Conversely, a lower weight of 90% will be assigned for incremental priority sector credit in districts where the credit flow is comparatively higher (per capita PSL greater than \u20b942,000). Districts not mentioned in Annexes IA and IB will maintain the existing weightage of 100%.",
            "generated_answer": "To address regional disparities, the PSL weights for each district are adjusted by multiplying them by a factor determined by the difference between the district's per capita credit outstanding under priority sector lending and the per capita credit outstanding for all districts combined. This adjustment aims to increase credit to districts with lower credit volumes relative to their needs. For example, if the per capita credit outstanding in a district is 60% of the average across all districts, the weight would be multiplied by 1.67. Districts with higher than average credit levels can have their weights reduced accordingly. However, there is a ceiling of 300% for the overall PSL targets applicable to districts with lower than average credit levels. The final credit target for a district is the product of its weighted credit target and the total PSL target. The specific district-wise weights are communicated to banks separately by the Reserve Bank of India. The overall PSL targets for these districts are set at 400% of the previous year's figure. The method of calculating the overall target and the district-wise weights will be further specified by the RBI in separate instructions. Banks must report the credit flow to these districts separately in their submissions. The weights for each district remain constant until the next triennial review. Any reduction in the overall PSL target due to negative net additions in these districts must be reflected in the overall target. If a district's overall PSL target is less than zero after reduction, it should be treated as zero. However, a district's PSL target cannot be reduced below the minimum floor of 200% of the previous year's actual PSL. The overall PSL target for a bank includes contributions from other banks operating within the same district. District-wise targets are determined by adding the contributions from all banks. The final allocation to each bank depends on the bank's performance in achieving the overall target. Banks are required to report the actual credit flows, including contributions from other banks, to the RBI quarterly. The RBI may also use this information to determine the share of credit to be attributed to individual banks. An overall contribution of 50% to priority sectors from other banks in a district to a bank's contribution is considered reasonable, but a lower contribution is acceptable. A bank's contribution to priority sector lending in a district is capped at 50% of the overall target for the district. The overall credit target is adjusted based on the contribution from other banks, and the final target is the residual amount after deducting the contributions from other banks. The final targets for each bank are determined after applying the appropriate weights and reductions for district-level disparities. The final targets for individual banks are determined after considering the overall target and the contributions from other banks. A bank's contribution to priority sector lending in a district is capped at 50% of the overall target for the district. The final target for each bank is calculated by allocating the residual target after accounting for contributions from other banks. The PSL targets for each district are then allocated among the banks operating within that district.

The computation of the exposure limit for these disclosure requirements should be done as per the guidelines provided for Non-Banking Financial Companies - Middle Layer.",
            "generated_answer": "Non-Banking Financial Companies should disclose their credit or investment concentration limits in the 'Notes to Accounts' section of their annual financial statements. For computing exposure limits for disclosure, NBFCS must use the maximum exposure method, considering all relevant exposures. The exposure limits apply to both funded and non-funded items, including derivatives positions held as an asset and derivatives collateral held as a liability. Additionally, any investments in securities issued by other regulated entities that have a direct credit risk on the NBFCS must also be included. Any exposure above the prescribed concentration limit should be disclosed as a separate item. If there's no exposure exceeding the limit, the NBFCS should disclose 'NIL'. The reporting of concentrations should cover all exposures without excluding inter-bank liabilities or assets held by subsidiaries, and the reported data should be broken down by type of exposure. The disclosure should also cover potential future exposure, indicating whether it exceeds the published limits. All disclosures should be segregated into current liabilities and capital funds.

Additionally, the cardholder must be immediately informed about the blocking, deactivation, or suspension, along with the reasons for it, through electronic means such as SMS, email, and other available modes.",
            "generated_answer": "When a card issuer blocks, deactivates, or suspends a debit or credit card, they must issue an immediate notification to the cardholder via SMS, email, or voice call, unless prohibited by law. This notification should explain the reason for the block/deactivation/suspension and provide instructions on how the customer can report the blocking to the card issuer's fraud hotlines or the nearest Regional Office of the Reserve Bank of India, and how to unblock the account. The notification must be sent in English and/or Hindi, if applicable, within 24 hours of the blocking, deactivation, or suspension, as per Section 50A(1)(c) of the Master Direction on Payment and Settlement Systems. If the card was blocked due to fraud, the card issuer must also forward details of the blocked account to the cardholder's registered mobile number or email address. The card issuer cannot charge the cardholder for these notifications. An exception exists for government-issued cards like PAN cards where such communications are governed by specific laws. The card issuer must provide the cardholder with a valid email or mobile number registered with them before issuing any blocking, deactivation, or suspension order. The card issuer must ensure the notification provides sufficient information for the cardholder to take appropriate action. The card issuer may use alternative means to notify the cardholder, such as their website or registered mobile number/email, but this is subject to Section 50A(1)(c) of the Master Direction on Payment and Settlement Systems. Blocking, deactivating, or suspending a card will not be considered fraud prevention or security measures unless done through the cardholder's registered mobile or email. The notification must also include contact details for reporting the blocking to the card issuer's fraud prevention helpline and the nearest Regional Office of the Reserve Bank of India. The card issuer must immediately unblock or reactivate the card after receiving a complaint from the cardholder regarding the blocking, deactivation, or suspension, without charging the cardholder for this service. If the card is blocked due to fraud, the unblocking process should occur immediately upon the cardholder reporting the fraud. Unblocking procedures should be communicated to cardholders at the time of issuance and on the card's packaging. If the card is blocked by mistake, the card issuer must unblock the account without charging the cardholder. If the card is blocked due to fraud, the unblocking process should occur immediately upon the cardholder reporting the fraud.

            "ground_truth_answer": "To manage risks associated with consumer credit, banks and NBFCs are required to establish Board-approved limits for various sub-segments within consumer credit. These limits should be part of their risk management framework and should address specific concerns related to different types of consumer loans.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) should conduct a comprehensive review of their exposures to specific sectors to ensure compliance with existing guidelines. They must also establish appropriate internal policies regarding sectoral exposure limits for consumer credit, ensuring these limits are consistent with their overall risk management framework. Additionally, banks are required to monitor and report all breaches of regulatory limits to the Department of Regulation (DoR), Reserve Bank of India (RBI). These breaches should be treated as deviations from regulatory guidelines, subject to penalties under applicable regulatory provisions. Banks should also ensure that their business plans align with regulatory requirements, including capital adequacy norms set by the RBI, to manage risks effectively. Finally, banks must adhere to the prudential norms laid down by the RBI, especially those concerning inter-corporate debt and exposure ceilings, to maintain financial stability and operational efficiency. For NBFCs, this includes adhering to the Master Direction \u2013 Lending Policy for NBFCs, which sets sector-wise exposure limits. Compliance with these limits is critical for sustainable growth and financial soundness. If a bank or NBFC breaches a limit, they must promptly report it to the RBI's Department of Regulation, detailing the breach, its impact on the bank's capital position, and the action being taken to address the issue. The bank should also submit an action plan to the RBI within 15 days of the breach, demonstrating how they intend to comply with the regulatory limits, and submit a periodic report on compliance at quarterly intervals. Failure to follow these guidelines may result in penal action under relevant regulatory provisions. Banks and NBFCs are also required to obtain prior approval from the RBI's Department of Regulation for any deviation from regulatory limits, such as increased exposure due to acquisition activity, expansion into new lines of business, or changes in existing business activities. This approval is necessary before taking any substantive decision that could affect the bank's capital position. Banks and NBFCs are ultimately responsible for managing their own risks, and the RBI's role is limited to issuing directions and conducting inspections, ensuring compliance with prudential norms. Banks and NBFCs must adhere to these guidelines, considering them part of their business conduct and complying with statutory and regulatory requirements. Violations may lead to penalties or further regulatory action. Banks and NBFCs are encouraged to adopt a conservative approach when setting sectoral exposure limits, considering factors like the bank's risk appetite, capital position, and economic conditions. A well-defined Board-approved policy is essential for effective risk management. The RBI will monitor the implementation of these guidelines closely and may take further supervisory actions if necessary. Banks and NBFCs are advised to consult the Master Direction \u2013 Lending Policy for NBFCs for sector-specific exposure limits and other relevant instructions. They are also encouraged to seek expert guidance on accounting and disclosure issues, as per Section 19(4) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The RBI may provide further clarifications on specific aspects of these guidelines. The Reserve Bank of India takes a proactive approach to monitoring and enforcing compliance with regulatory standards. It has the authority to initiate regulatory action against entities that fail to adhere to these guidelines, including imposing penalties. The RBI may also request additional information or clarification from banks and NBFCs regarding their compliance status. Banks and NBFCs are encouraged to implement strict internal controls, especially for large loans, to prevent over-exposure and maintain financial stability. Regular audits of loan accounts are crucial for maintaining proper records and identifying potential over-extension of credit. The RBI reserves the right to request additional details from banks and NBFCs regarding their compliance with these guidelines. Banks are expected to demonstrate commitment to risk management principles, including the establishment of robust risk management systems, regular internal audits, and adherence to regulatory guidelines. The RBI will continue to review and refine these guidelines based on the evolving needs of the banking sector.

            "question": "What constitutes credit exposure for Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs), and what is excluded from it?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "For Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs), credit exposure includes funded and non-funded credit limits, underwriting commitments, equipment leasing, hire purchase financing, and ad hoc limits sanctioned to borrowers. However, it excludes loans and advances granted against the security of the bank's own term deposits. The sanctioned limit or outstanding amount, whichever is higher, is used to determine the credit exposure limit.",
            "generated_answer": "For Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs), credit exposure includes all advances and investments, net of specific provisions for doubtful and non-performing assets. It excludes deposits raised by UCBs and their funded and non-funded guarantees. However, investments made by UCBs in government securities, including those issued by the Central and State Governments, are excluded from this definition. Investments in units of Venture Capital Funds also remain outside the scope of credit exposure. Expenditures on capital stock, whether funded directly by the UCB or through borrowings, are treated as part of the capital base and not included in credit exposure. Direct loans extended by a UCB to another UCB or a loan between two entities where one entity is wholly-owned by the other are considered inter-bank transactions and are excluded from credit exposure. Similarly, inter-company deposits with subsidiaries are not treated as credit exposure. Also excluded are inter-bank advances at commercial terms without recourse to the bank's own sources of funds. Loans granted to a group undertaking where the bank's credit exposure is subordinated to the claims of other lenders are considered a component of equity capital and not classified as a loan or advance receivable. Expenditures on capital stock incurred by an enterprise for which a bank has provided credit facilities are treated as part of the capital base. Expenditures undertaken by a bank for its own expansion or acquisitions are also excluded. In cases where a bank grants loans to a group undertaking and is permitted to take a shareholding in the undertaking, the bank can treat the shareholding as part of its investment portfolio. This exception applies only to the extent of the shareholding held. The credit exposure does not include advances to employees of the UCB for their private vehicles unless they are covered under the provisions regarding loans against life insurance policies. The amount sanctioned for loans against life insurance policies is treated as a loan facility to the policyholders. Credit facilities granted to UCBs against the security of gold ornaments are also excluded. A loan granted to a branch of a bank or a subsidiary undertaking to the parent bank is also excluded from the definition of credit exposure. Loans extended by UCBs to their own branches in the same category are excluded. Advances to members for their private purposes that are secured by specific security, including gold ornaments, are also excluded. UCBs cannot provide overdraft facilities to individuals or partners in firms without a separate credit limit being sanctioned for the purpose. The provision for doubtful and non-performing assets is not included in the credit exposure. However, contingent liabilities arising out of guarantees and commitments, such as those taken over by the Reserve Bank of India, are treated as part of credit exposure. Expenditures on capital stock made by a UCB for the expansion of its activities are also excluded from credit exposure. UCBs can transfer a loan made to a group undertaking to another lender in a manner that does not involve recourse to the bank's own resources. An example of this is a loan obtained by an UCB to a group undertaking, which is then transferred to another bank, where the UCB continues to be liable for the payment of principal and interest to the UCB's lender. This type of transfer is excluded from the credit exposure definition. Advances to directors, including family members, are not considered part of the credit exposure. Advances to a director who is also a partner in the business are treated as a loan to the partnership firm. Advances to partners are not included if the partnership agreement stipulates that all partners are liable jointly and severally for the debts of the partnership. Advances to directors who are partners in a firm are treated as loans to the firm, and any advance to a partner who is also a director is treated as a loan to the partner. Advances to directors where the firm is registered as a company and the director is a partner in the firm are treated as loans to the company, irrespective of whether the director is also a partner. Advances to directors where the firm is registered as a company and the director is also an employee of the company are treated as loans to the director or to the company. Advances to directors of a company where the director also holds an office under the company are excluded. Advances to directors, excluding family members, where the firm is registered as a partnership are excluded, provided that the director is not a partner. Advances to directors who are partners in a partnership firm where the partnership agreement provides that the partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts of the partnership are not included. Advances to directors who are partners in a partnership firm where the partnership agreement does not specify that the partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts of the partnership are not included, except where the partner is also a director in the same firm. Advances to directors who are partners in a partnership firm where the partnership agreement specifies that the partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts of the partnership, and the director is also a partner are included.

            "ground_truth_answer": "Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) are individuals who have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country. This includes Heads of States or Governments, senior politicians, senior government, judicial, or military officers, senior executives of state-owned corporations, and important political party officials.",
            "generated_answer": "A Politically Exposed Person (PEP) is defined as a person who currently holds a government or executive position in a foreign country, including individuals occupying these positions in an international organization. Examples include current heads of state or government, senior officials from national defense forces, central banks, monetary authorities, or fiscal or administrative councils; senior executive officers of political parties holding office at national, regional, or local levels; members of royal families of foreign states; and their spouses and children residing in the household. Individuals who were previously in such positions are also considered PEPs if they continue to meet the criteria after leaving office. This definition excludes senior executives of international companies based in India. Individuals serving as non-executive directors of banks, insurance companies, securities firms, mutual funds, trust companies, or other financial institutions are also categorized as PEPs. The designation of PEPs is determined by the bank's Board of Directors or senior management. If a person is identified as a PEP, all transactions with them require special authorization from the Head Office. For transactions with family members of PEPs, the standard authorization process applies. A family member is defined as a spouse, child, parent, brother, or sister. An individual acting in an official capacity as a head of state, government official, or other senior position is also considered a PEP. Individuals in these positions are exempt from being listed as PEPs. The definitions of PEPs are subject to change based on changes in laws or regulations. Individuals suspected of involvement in corruption are generally treated as PEPs, unless there is sufficient evidence to prevent this treatment. A list of PEPs is maintained by the FIU-IND and is available upon request. Individuals listed in the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) consolidated lists are also considered PEPs. In cases where a person is listed as a PEP but has been removed from the list due to a decision by the government, they are still considered a PEP for regulatory purposes until officially removed. However, if a PEP is removed from the list, they are no longer considered a PEP. The definitions of PEPs under the Master Direction on Know Your Customer (KYC) do not apply to individuals or entities specifically identified as PEPs by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). If a person is listed as a PEP by the UNSC, they are treated as such for regulatory purposes. The definition of 'family member' for PEPs also includes individuals who have been convicted of money laundering or terrorist financing offenses. Individuals suspected of having committed money laundering or terrorist financing crimes are treated as PEPs until proven otherwise. Individuals suspected of being involved in terrorist financing activities are treated as PEPs under the Master Direction on KYC. Individuals suspected of involvement in the financing of terrorism are also considered PEPs. Individuals suspected of being associated with Al-Qaida or other listed terrorist organizations are treated as PEPs. Individuals suspected of being associated with ISIL (Daesh) and other listed terrorist organizations are considered PEPs. Individuals suspected of being associated with other listed terrorist organizations are also treated as PEPs. Individuals suspected of being associated with individuals or entities listed for having terrorist links are considered PEPs.

            "ground_truth_answer": "Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) are required to assess a borrower's repayment capacity when sanctioning Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) based floating rate housing loans. This assessment ensures sufficient headroom for potential increases in the loan tenor or EMI amount if benchmark rates rise during the loan term. UCBs should also establish a policy framework for resetting floating interest rates on these loans.",
            "generated_answer": "Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) must ensure that borrowers have adequate repayment capacity before sanctioning EMI based floating rate housing loans. When these loans are reset due to market rates changes, the increase in interest charges should not exceed 2% of the loan amount at the time of sanctioning the loan. Additionally, UCBs should avoid linking the rate of interest to the price of gold in their loan agreements. Any change in interest rates should be communicated to borrowers at least three months in advance of the next reset date. For self-constructed properties, the interest rate should reflect the bank's risk assessment as appropriate. For properties financed through agency arrangements, banks should consider factors like borrower's repayment capacity and risks associated with non-performing assets (NPAs) of the agency scheme. The pricing of housing loans should align with internal credit appraisal practices and comply with RBI guidelines regarding loan pricing. UCBs should also adhere to the terms outlined in paragraph 5 of the Master Circular on Credit Risk Management of UCBs, dated October 10, 2023, regarding exposure limits. For government-sponsored housing schemes like Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), banks should ensure transparency and adherence to the scheme's norms.

UCBs must also adhere to the provisions of Section 29A of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987. For UCBs issuing housing loans to individuals without a housing loan history, the applicable ceiling should be applied until the individual has a record of repaying a housing loan. UCBs should also adhere to the instructions regarding the maximum interest rate applicable to housing loans in rural areas as stated in paragraph 2.1.4 of the Master Circular on Credit Risk Management of UCBs, dated October 10, 2023. UCBs are required to report compliance details to the Department of Supervision Regulation (DSR) of RBI at quarterly intervals. The circular also specifies penalties for non-compliance, including deductions from Tier II reserves and imposition of monetary penalties. UCBs are required to submit a declaration confirming they have followed the prescribed guidelines within fourteen days of the date of the circular. This circular supersedes all previous circulars on similar matters. All new schemes initiated by UCBs after this date should adhere to the instructions outlined in this circular. UCBs are expected to establish a board-approved policy to address complaints received during the implementation of the circular, ensuring proper and expeditious resolution of issues. UCBs must also adhere to the Master Direction on Board and Management, issued by the Department of Supervision Regulation, RBI.

The decision to write off or continue pursuing recovery should align with the bank's policies, considering factors like legal feasibility, collectability, and potential for fraud detection. Banks should avoid transferring these accounts to special or non-performing assets categories.

            "generated_answer": "Infrastructure Debt Fund-NBFCs (IDF-NBFCs) are permitted to undertake activities similar to those conducted by Commercial Banks and are subject to all applicable regulatory guidelines, conditions, and restrictions set forth by the Reserve Bank. These funds can also invest in infrastructure-related instruments issued by other entities, provided they comply with the stipulations outlined in the Master Direction on Non-Banking Financial Companies - Infrastructure Debt Funds (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2023. For investments in Infrastructure Debt Instruments (IDIs), IDF-NBFCs must adhere to specific conditions, including limits on investments in individual IDI issuances and overall exposure to IDI issuers. Additionally, IDF-NBFCs are prohibited from providing guarantees or counter-guarantees for loans and advances, as these would be considered commercial lending. They are also subject to prudential norms governing NBFCs as prescribed in the Master Direction on Non-Banking Financial Company \u2013 National Housing Bank (NBFC-NHB) (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2023. Furthermore, IDF-NBFCs must not engage in deposits business, except for the purpose of raising funds for investment in Infrastructure Debt Instruments, and they are not allowed to provide financial accommodation to their promoters or directors.

            "question": "What percentage of total advances outstanding should be covered when selecting branches for audit, and what other criteria should be considered?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "When selecting branches for audit, at least 70% of the total advances outstanding should be covered. The top 20 branches, or the top 20% of branches for banks with fewer than 100 branches, must be included based on outstanding advances. Branches suspected of fraud or with suspicious transactions should be audited, and branches with loan or business growth of 50% or more over the preceding year should also be included.",
            "generated_answer": "When selecting branches for audit, at least 75% of the total advances outstanding should be covered. Other relevant factors such as the number of branches with sanctioned limits exceeding Rs.10 crore, higher non-performing asset ratios, and branches with significant exposures to specific sectors or industries should also be considered. These factors may influence the selection of branches beyond the 75% target. The final list of branches to be audited is determined by the Lead Manager after consulting the Board of Directors. Selection criteria can also be determined by the Board based on the Lead Manager's recommendation. An exception is made for branches that have been closed due to insolvency, liquidation, or sale, as their audit is excluded from this requirement. For small branches, the proportion of accounts included in the audit may be reduced accordingly. The overall sample size must cover at least 75% of all branches. If the number of branches exceeds 100, a random sample can be used instead of a systematic one. All branches should be audited at least once every five years, unless there is evidence of fraud or major internal changes. The exact time frame between two audits can vary from 2 to 4 years, depending on the branch's performance. If a branch's credit exposure exceeds Rs.200 crore, it may be subject to a special audit. A special audit is also required if a branch has suffered losses exceeding Rs.5 crore during the previous three years or if its NPA ratio exceeds 5%. Branches with less than Rs.200 crore of credit exposure are exempt from special auditing. Banks should also conduct an internal audit for branches with total assets of Rs.200 crore and above, without considering the amount of bank finance. These internal audits should be conducted periodically and not necessarily coincide with external audits. The results of these internal audits should be reported to senior management. Senior managers should also visit branches with significant losses or significant growth in non-performing assets. A board-approved policy should address the frequency, scope, content, and timing of both internal and external audits. The selection of branches for both internal and external audits should be independent of each other. The internal audit function should be separate from the loan sanctioning authority and perform regular audits of loan accounts. The lead auditor should review the work of the internal auditor before submitting their report to senior management. The scope of internal auditing should include compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements, compliance with the bank's policies, and proper accounting practices. The internal auditor should ensure that the branch manager is responsible for maintaining records, reporting discrepancies, and taking corrective action. The internal auditor should also verify that the valuation of securities is correct and that the board is aware of the realisable value. The lead auditor should also review the adequacy of branch staff, including the number of loan officials and staff dedicated to collections. Banks should establish a mechanism for handling complaints from borrowers about loan sanctions and disbursal procedures. Complaints should be addressed promptly and satisfactorily to prevent delays and ensure customer satisfaction. Complaints should be forwarded to a specially constituted committee for investigation and resolution. The committee should consist of the Lead Manager, Regional Manager, and Deputy General Manager.

            "question": "Why are working capital facilities extended to construction companies working as contractors not considered Commercial Real Estate (CRE) exposures?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "Loans extended to construction companies working as contractors are not treated as Commercial Real Estate (CRE) exposures because repayment depends on contractual payments received as work progresses.",
            "generated_answer": "Working capital facilities extended to construction companies working as contractors are generally not classified as Commercial Real Estate (CRE) exposures because they do not directly involve real estate assets. The facilities are typically used to finance the company's operational needs related to building construction. While some financing may be extended for buildings that will become commercial properties, the primary purpose is to support the contractor's business activities rather than creating real estate assets. Therefore, these facilities should not be treated as CRE exposures. However, if the facility involves real estate assets and is specifically linked to the creation of a real estate asset, it would be classified as a real estate loan under CRE. If the facilities extend beyond construction contracts and are considered long-term loans tied to the creation of real estate assets, they should be classified as real estate loans. Exposures where the company's work capacity is limited to a single project due to government restrictions on the number of projects a contractor can undertake at once, resulting in a revolving nature of credit, could also be considered CRE. Additionally, credit facilities extended to builders for construction work should not be included in the definition of CRE unless there is a direct relationship between the construction work and the real estate development. This includes construction work undertaken by builders against letters of intent (LOI) for properties. If the construction is financed from bank loans and the agreement specifies that the property belongs to the bank upon completion, the exposure should be classified as CRE. The same classification applies when construction work is financed through bills and the agreement specifies that the property belongs to the bank upon completion. If the construction work is financed using funds raised by the developer/property owner from investors and a letter of undertaking (LOU) is issued by the bank stating that the bank will own the property if the construction is completed on time, the exposure should be classified as CRE. Lastly, when construction work is financed through the bank's bill purchase facility and the agreement states that the property belongs to the bank after completion, the exposure should also be classified as CRE. For construction work financed through the bank's bill purchase facility where the bank has issued an LOU stating that the bank will own the property upon completion, the exposure should also be classified as CRE. When construction work is financed using funds raised by the developer/property owner from banks and non-banks and a bank issue an LOU stating that the bank will own the property upon completion, the exposure should also be classified as CRE. Finally, when construction work is financed using funds raised by the developer/property owner from banks and non-banks and a bank issues an LOU stating that the bank will own the property upon completion, the exposure should also be classified as CRE. However, all other cases of construction work should not be considered CRE. Exposure to a builder who has been involved in construction work without a valid construction contract, either partially or fully, should also not be considered CRE. A valid contract is one that includes the terms of payment, payment schedule, and completion date. An unfulfilled contract is defined as one where the construction has not commenced, payment has not been received, or payments have ceased due to the contractor's default. For construction work financed through loans from banks and non-banks, if the bank's LOU provides that the bank will own the property upon completion, the exposure should be classified as CRE. If the bank's LOU does not provide for the bank to own the property upon completion, the exposure should not be classified as CRE. All other cases of construction work should not be considered CRE. Exposures to builders who have been involved in construction work without a valid construction contract, either partially or fully, should also not be considered CRE. A valid contract is one that includes the terms of payment, payment schedule, and completion date.

            "question": "What action does the Reserve Bank of India take after the sum for a contravention has been compounded and realized?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "After the sum for which a contravention is compounded is realized, the Reserve Bank of India issues a certificate, potentially with specified conditions included in the order.",
            "generated_answer": "After realizing the amount for a contravention, the Reserve Bank of India will issue a certificate to the person who paid the amount. This certificate serves as evidence that the contravention has been fully addressed and removed from the person's record. The certificate is valid for one year from the date of issuance. If no certificate is issued within this timeframe, the person can approach the concerned Regional Office of the Reserve Bank of India for a certificate acknowledging the contravention has been cleared. Additionally, a certificate must be obtained for each payment received during the previous year to demonstrate compliance with the requirement to clear all contraventions. Finally, if the contravention was related to money laundering or terrorist financing, a certificate confirming complete clearance is required from the FIU-IND. All certificates must be submitted within three months from the issuance of the earlier certificate. No further charges will be levied upon receipt of these certificates. If the Reserve Bank of India does not provide the necessary certificate, the person can seek a court order for the cancellation of the certificate. However, if the court grants the order, the person may not obtain a certificate from the Reserve Bank of India for a period of two years from the date of the judgment, unless they pay the entire amount again. The bank account will remain blocked until the contravention is fully cleared. A copy of the judgment must be provided to the Enforcement Directorate. For cases involving contraventions related to money laundering or terrorist financing, the period for obtaining a certificate from the FIU-IND is extended to two years from the date of the judgment. Any breach of these instructions by the Reserve Bank of India will result in disciplinary action. Banks are also advised not to release funds to individuals pending contravention clearance. The Reserve Bank of India's authority extends beyond banking to cover all forms of financial transactions. If an individual commits a contravention outside of banking, they should contact the relevant Central or State Government agency responsible for regulating that sector for contravention clearance. Once the Reserve Bank of India confirms that the contravention has been fully cleared and the person satisfies the conditions mentioned, they may seek an order from the court for the lifting of any restraining orders issued by the court. The bank must then provide the court with a certificate stating that the Reserve Bank of India has cleared the contravention, and the court may lift the restraining order accordingly. In cases where the contravention is due to negligence on the part of the bank, the Reserve Bank of India will issue a certificate to the bank, which can then apply to the concerned High Court for the lifting of restraining orders. The court may issue an interim order allowing the bank to pay money to the customer pending contravention clearance. The final decision on whether to allow payment will be made at the time of hearing the matter. If the court rules that the bank did not commit a contravention, it will lift the restraining order immediately. If the court rules that the bank committed a contravention, it may lift the restraining order upon payment of the amount due to the Reserve Bank of India. The bank must provide the court with a certificate from the Reserve Bank of India confirming the contravention has been cleared before applying to lift the restraining order. The Restraining Order (RO) dated February 10, 2024, continues in effect until the Reserve Bank of India issues a certificate confirming the contravention has been cleared. The court retains the power to lift the restraining order at any time if the bank fails to comply with the Reserve Bank of India's instructions. The court will consider the Reserve Bank of India's certificate in conjunction with the court order. In cases where the restraining order is lifted by the court, the bank is required to pay the Reserve Bank of India the amount due within seven days of receiving the certificate from the Reserve Bank of India. Failure to do so will result in additional charges being levied on the bank. The court may also order the bank to pay interest on the unclaimed amount and other consequential charges. The Reserve Bank of India must submit the certificates of contravention clearance to the Enforcement Directorate and the FIU-IND within three months of receipt. The bank must also ensure that the customer receives the certificate. The bank is liable for any liabilities arising from non-payment of dues, including fines, arrears, and penal charges. The Reserve Bank of India's instructions regarding the handling of restraining orders apply to banks operating in India and foreign branches thereof, as well as banking companies operating in India through their wholly-owned subsidiaries. The provisions of these instructions supersede any previous instructions on restraining orders issued by the Reserve Bank of India. The Reserve Bank of India retains the right to take further action against individuals, banks, or agencies that violate these instructions. The Reserve Bank of India may refer any individual, bank, or agency found in violation to the Indian Banking Ombudsmen Society (IBOS), which has the authority to impose sanctions. The Reserve Bank of India may also refer the matter to the Enforcement Directorate (ED)",

            "question": "What types of settlement options are included in the guidelines for resolving non-performing assets?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "The guidelines address compromise settlements, negotiated settlements, and one-time settlements as methods for resolving non-performing assets.",
            "generated_answer": "The guidelines specify various settlement options for resolving non-performing assets, including cash, security receipts, and asset swaps. Security receipts can be either physical or electronic. Asset swaps involve the exchange of an NPAs for other eligible assets like government securities, cash reserves, or capital instruments. For NPAs classified as 'sub-standard', the guidelines also allow for the issuance of fresh bank facilities against existing NPA accounts or the conversion of NPA facilities into fresh ones, provided they meet specific criteria. The guidelines also cover the sale of NPAs to third parties, including their conversion into government securities through auctions. Cash settlement involves the purchase of NPAs by banks from one another. The sale of NPAs between banks is subject to Board approval and must adhere to established credit appraisal and sanction procedures, with a commitment not to resell them for a minimum period of two years from the date of acquisition. The guidelines also address the resolution of NPAs arising from the acquisition of commercial real estate properties. The sale of NPAs to third parties is permitted under certain conditions, subject to board-approved policies and robust internal arrangements for risk management. These transactions are treated as sales, and specific disclosures are required in the bank's financial statements. The guidelines further outline the process for realizing amounts received from the sale of NPAs to third parties. Finally, the guidelines provide for the disposal of NPAs to specialized agencies through structured arrangements. For NPAs classified as 'doubtful', the guidelines suggest writing off the outstanding amount and releasing funds for restructuring or write-offs, provided that appropriate credit appraisal and sanction processes are followed and necessary disclosures are made in the bank's financial statements. The guidelines also clarify that banks should cease further payments to NPA borrowers and take legal action if default continues despite these steps. Banks are also advised to use the court system to enforce their rights, especially regarding the sale of mortgaged property, and seek judicial intervention when necessary. They may also offer assistance to distressed borrowers through rehabilitation committees or similar bodies. Banks are encouraged to establish efficient and effective systems to minimize losses due to NPAs and should avoid providing financing to entities involved in illegal activities. The guidelines also emphasize the importance of sound administration of loans and the need to prevent frauds and unauthorized advances. Banks are expected to closely monitor the implementation of these guidelines at all levels and report compliance to the RBI regularly.

This approval should be sought at least three months before the end of their current term. The approval is valid for a period not exceeding one year, unless an extension is granted by the RBI. For appointments after the first year, the RBI must approve the appointment before the existing Director's term expires. The RBI may also consider any other circumstances relevant to the candidate's suitability. The appointment of an individual as Managing Director or Chief Executive Officer requires special approval from the RBI. All appointments must comply with statutory requirements. A person cannot be appointed as both a Director and an officer-in-charge of a functional department. Any appointments made without obtaining necessary approvals are considered invalid. The Board of Directors must establish clear guidelines for Director appointments, including procedures for seeking and obtaining approval from the RBI. If a Director or officer-in-charge fails to seek such approval within the prescribed timeframe, they will be required to vacate their position pending the issuance of a No Objection Certificate (NOC). In cases where the RBI does not provide NOC, the Board can initiate a process to remove the Director or officer-in-charge. If no candidate is available to take up the post, the Board must seek RBI approval for a temporary appointment to complete the tenure. Any appointment without RBI approval will be treated as irregular, leading to immediate removal of the Director. The Board must keep the RBI informed about the status of the appointment or re-appointment process. The RBI will consider the Board's decision if the process is not completed within 90 days from the end of the Director's term. The RBI may also review the Board's decision if there is no appointment during the first 180 days. The Board must submit copies of all approvals to the RBI annually. The RBI retains the right to remove Directors who fail to secure RBI approval within the allotted time. These rules do not apply to appointments to Regional Offices of ARC. The RBI will issue separate directions for appointment of officers to Regional Offices. The Board must also seek prior approval from the RBI before appointing Directors or Managing Directors to wholly-owned subsidiaries or branches, or granting them powers similar to those of Managing Directors or Chief Executive Officers. If a director of the subsidiary or branch is already a Director of the ARC, their appointment requires further approval from the RBI. The Board must provide reasons for any non-compliance with these guidelines. The RBI may grant exceptions to the above-mentioned approval process for directors appointed from outside India. For appointments as Managing Director or CEO, the RBI will consider whether the candidate has sufficient skills and experience in financial management, as well as other relevant factors. The RBI may also consider the candidate's previous experience as a Director or Managing Director of an ARC or another financial institution.

The Board must provide reasons for any non-compliance. The Board must submit a copy of the approved Bye-Laws to the RBI for record-keeping purposes. If the Bye-Laws contain provisions that contradict any statutory requirements or RBI bye-laws, the RBI has the power to refuse registration or re-registration.

The Board must also inform the RBI about any material changes in the Memorandum or Articles of Association that could affect the ARC's status or operations. The Board must ensure that all statutory provisions and RBI bye-laws are strictly followed in the conduct of business. The Board must submit a copy of the audited accounts of the ARC to the RBI for record-keeping purposes, even if the auditors are not appointed by the RBI.

            "ground_truth_answer": "Small Finance Banks applying to transition into Universal Banks must have shares listed on a recognized stock exchange.",
            "generated_answer": "Small Finance Banks (SFBs) that wish to transition into Universal Banks (UBs) must list their shares on either the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) or the National Stock Exchange (NSE). This requirement applies irrespective of whether they already have an IPO conducted at the time of application. Failure to meet this requirement will result in disqualification from applying for UB status. However, if the SFB is currently listed on NSE but delisted due to non-renewal of the license for continued listing, they may apply for UB status after being listed again on another recognized stock exchange. The application process for these banks would follow the same timeline as other applications. This requirement also applies to existing SFBs that have already applied for UB status before the issuance of the notification. If an SFB already has a license issued by the RBI for a different purpose, such as a Payment & Settlement Systems (PSS) bank, it is considered ineligible for the UCB route. For SFBs applying for licenses under the PSS framework, all details pertaining to eligibility should be clearly mentioned in the application documents submitted to the RBI. The final determination of eligibility will be made by the RBI upon receipt of the application. The process of listing shares on a stock exchange is subject to the relevant provisions of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act of 1956 and the Reserve Bank of India (Stock Exchanges) Directions. Any queries related to the stock exchange listing of these banks must be addressed to the Department of Regulation (DoR) of the Reserve Bank of India. If there are concerns about the eligibility of an SFB for the UCB route due to potential listing issues, the RBI may consider recommending an alternate route for entry into the banking sector. Applications for UCB status will be considered after the initial submission of the application. A specific set of documents required for UCB applications will be uploaded on the RBI's website, and the application process will adhere to the timelines established for other UCB applicants.

            "ground_truth_answer": "Banks must adhere to the guidelines outlined in the 'Management of Intra-Group Transactions and Exposures' to manage transactions and exposures within their group when dealing with Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs). These guidelines ensure that intra-group transactions do not pose excessive risks to the bank or the financial system.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks must adhere to specific guidelines when assessing intra-group transactions and exposures involving Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs). These guidelines are designed to ensure financial stability and prevent conflicts of interest within the bank's operations. Banks are also required to obtain prior approval from the Department of Regulation (DoR), Reserve Bank of India, for any transaction that exceeds defined limits, irrespective of whether the counterparty is an NBFC or another entity. Failure to obtain such approval may result in a penalty of INR 10,000 per day for each day the approval remains outstanding. Additionally, banks should avoid giving loans to NBFCs against their own shares, debentures, or other securities issued by the bank itself. They are also prohibited from providing inter-company accommodation facilities, which include borrowing money from subsidiaries or associates for the purpose of lending to third parties. Finally, banks must ensure they do not grant unsecured or partially secured loans to NBFCs that have secured financing from other sources. These restrictions apply whether the loan is for acquisitions, mergers, or expansions. The restrictions also extend to advances granted to entities like business trusts and investment companies that hold loans against share capital issued by NBFCs. Banks are not allowed to finance their own investments in the stock markets and must avoid granting loans to others for such purposes. The restrictions also apply to loans granted to directors and their relatives. The Reserve Bank has the authority to issue guidelines in this area, including adjustments to existing limits where necessary. If these guidelines conflict with existing instructions, the new guidelines take precedence. Banks must adhere to all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, including those outlined in the Master Direction on Priority Sector Lending (PSL). The Department of Supervision (DoS) will monitor compliance with these guidelines. In cases of non-compliance, the Reserve Bank may impose penalties, such as imposing a stop-loss order. A stop-loss order prevents a bank from undertaking certain activities until the department certifies that the bank has corrected the non-compliance. Banks can challenge the stop-loss order in court. Penalties for violations can be fixed at INR 10,000 per day for each day the breach persists. The Reserve Bank reserves the right to adjust or modify the current limits based on the bank's performance and other relevant factors. The final guidelines are determined by the Reserve Bank's Board of Directors. The process for obtaining approval for transactions exceeding specified limits is outlined in the Master Direction on Priority Sector Lending (PSL). This includes provisions for determining the board-approved limit for intra-group transactions and exposures. Banks must obtain prior approval from the Department of Regulation (DoR), Reserve Bank of India, for any transaction that exceeds specified limits, irrespective of whether the counterparty is an NBFC or another entity. Failure to obtain such approval may result in a penalty of INR 10,000 per day for each day the approval remains outstanding. The penalty applies until the bank obtains the necessary approval from the DoR. The department also has the authority to approve any transaction that exceeds the specified limits, with prior approval from the DoR required only for transactions above the approved limit. Banks are prohibited from financing their own investments in the stock markets and must avoid granting loans to others for such purposes. The restrictions also apply to loans granted to directors and their relatives. Banks are also prohibited from extending accommodation facilities to subsidiaries or associates for acquiring loans from third parties, except in cases where the subsidiaries or associates have been identified as Priority Sector Lending targets and the bank has already provided loans to them.

            "question": "What is the general role of the Banking Regulation Act of 1949 in the context of banking companies in India?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "The Banking Regulation Act of 1949 governs the functioning of banking companies in India, setting standards for their operations, management, and financial stability.",
            "generated_answer": "The Banking Regulation Act of 1949 serves as the primary legislation governing banking companies in India, outlining their regulatory framework and operational requirements. It ensures sound banking practices and financial stability within the sector. The Central Government exercises supervisory authority over banking companies under this act. As of March 31, 2024, 500 banking companies were classified as Scheduled Banks under the Banking Regulation Act. The act also provides for the appointment of authorized representative offices by foreign banks. These offices function according to the Foreign Exchange Management Act of 1999 and other relevant laws. The act empowers the RBI to monitor and control the financial health of banking entities, ensuring compliance with monetary policy guidelines and fostering healthy competition in the banking sector. Under Section 16(1)(c) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, banking companies must report details of their audited balance sheets to the RBI annually, including information about investments made in other banking companies and in non-banking financial companies. These balance sheets are compiled in a specific format and submitted on specified dates. The act's provisions apply uniformly to all banking companies, regardless of whether they have been designated as Scheduled Banks. The RBI has the power to designate a bank as a scheduled bank, which signifies that it meets the criteria outlined in the Banking Regulation Act and is subject to its regulatory framework. The act defines what constitutes a banking company and sets the standards for their operations and financial reporting. The RBI can also remove a banking company from the list of scheduled banks if it no longer meets the criteria. Additionally, the act outlines the process for converting a scheduled bank into a banking company and vice versa, providing clarity on the transition between these two categories of banking institutions. The act also includes provisions regarding the appointment of directors to banking companies and the powers of the RBI to take action against unauthorized activities carried out by banking companies. Finally, the act addresses the role of the RBI in issuing licenses to banking companies and provides a framework for the conduct of business by these entities. Overall, the Banking Regulation Act of 1949 serves as the foundational legislation for regulating banking companies in India, ensuring their financial stability and adherence to regulatory guidelines. It defines the scope of operations for banking companies, establishes the RBI's supervisory role, and provides a comprehensive legal framework for the functioning of the banking sector. The act is regularly updated to reflect changes in the banking landscape and regulatory requirements, ensuring the continued relevance and effectiveness of its provisions. Scheduled banks are subject to specific conditions and obligations, such as maintaining certain levels of capital and adhering to prudential norms, while other banking companies operate under different regulations. The act also addresses issues related to mergers, acquisitions, and restructuring of banking companies, promoting healthy competition and sustainable growth in the banking industry. The RBI can take corrective measures against banking companies that violate the act's provisions, including imposing penalties for non-compliance. The act's provisions cover various aspects of banking operations, including loans, advances, investments, and disclosures, ensuring transparency and accountability in the banking sector. The act's amendments reflect ongoing efforts to modernize banking regulation and enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of the banking system. The Banking Regulation Act of 1949 is the cornerstone of India's banking regulatory framework, defining the scope of banking activities and setting the standards for financial stability and sound business practices. Scheduled banks are subject to stricter oversight and regulatory requirements compared to other banking companies, reflecting the importance placed on their role in the Indian economy. The act's provisions provide a robust legal foundation for the functioning of banking companies in India, ensuring their compliance with regulatory guidelines and contributing to the overall stability and development of the banking sector. The act's amendments have been designed to address evolving challenges and improve the efficiency of banking operations, reflecting ongoing efforts to strengthen the regulatory framework and promote sustainable growth in the banking industry. The Banking Regulation Act of 1949 continues to be the primary legislative instrument governing the regulation of banking companies in India, providing the legal basis for their operations and ensuring the stability and health of the banking sector. Scheduled banks adhere to more stringent conditions and regulatory requirements compared to other banking companies, reflecting their unique position and responsibilities in the Indian financial system.

To differentiate between April transactions (financial year 2023-24) and March Residual Transactions, the statement pertaining to March Residual Transactions should be clearly marked as \"March Residual Account\".",
            "generated_answer": "Nodal/Focal Point branches must report all transactions pertaining to April 2023 within the April reporting window. They should also distinctly mark April 2023 transactions as such in their reports, using a specific legend. Additionally, these April transactions need to be segregated from March Residual Transactions. The April transactions may require special attention due to potential discrepancies in the reporting window. Nodal/Focal Point branches are required to provide a reason for any non-availability of data for March Residual Transactions. March Residual Transactions should be reported in separate columns within the same reporting window, clearly marked as 'March Residual Transactions', alongside April transactions, using different legends to distinguish them. Special attention should be given to the reporting format of March Residual Transactions from various agencies. A 'N/A' notation should be used to indicate that no data was available for reporting. Any discrepancy between the actual number of transactions reported by banks and the number of accounts in their books should be flagged separately. For April transactions, transactions involving resident individuals and resident entities in foreign currency should be reported separately, with separate legends used to distinguish them from domestic transactions. The number of accounts reported under 'Resident Individual/Resident Entity in Foreign Currency' should be included in the total number of accounts reported for April transactions, as these accounts may have been reported under March Residual Transactions. If there are multiple banks in a jurisdiction reporting, each bank must report the number of transactions for both March Residual Transactions and April transactions separately, with a legend used to distinguish them. Banks should also report any discrepancies in the number of accounts in their books during the reporting period. Separate legends should be used to indicate whether March Residual Transactions were reported fully or partially. Lastly, all transactions reported during the month of April should be in conformity with the actual accounting year ending March 31, 2024. March Residual Transactions and April transactions should not be combined in the same reporting window. If a transaction occurs in April but is debited to March accounts, it should be treated as a March Residual Transaction. For example, if a transaction is recorded in the Centralized Information Management System (CIMS) on April 7, it should be considered a March Residual Transaction even if the account statement is returned on April 8. All dates mentioned in the circular refer to the Gregorian calendar year 2023. Transactions occurring before March 31, 2023, should be reported as 'other transactions'. The reporting window for April transactions is April 1 through April 15, 2023. For March Residual Transactions, banks should report transactions occurred from March 31, 2023, up to March 31, 2024. The reporting window for March Residual Transactions is March 31, 2024, through April 10, 2024. March Residual Transactions must be reported in the same format and legend as regular March transactions. April transactions will be treated as an initial batch, and March Residual Transactions will be treated as a residual batch.

            "question": "What steps should banks take to simplify the activation of inoperative or frozen accounts?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "Banks should enable KYC updates through mobile/internet banking, non-home branches, or Video Customer Identification Process (VCIP) to streamline account activation. They should also take an empathetic approach when activating accounts of beneficiaries of government schemes, and organize special campaigns for activation. Additionally, banks may facilitate Aadhaar updates for customers through branches providing Aadhaar-related services.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks should streamline the activation process for inoperative or frozen accounts by providing a simple procedure that allows customers to activate their accounts without requiring detailed documentation. This can be achieved through various channels such as branches, call centers, and mobile devices. Banks should also establish an internal committee to address customer complaints regarding account activation and provide transparent guidelines for activating these accounts. Additionally, banks should communicate this process to their branch staff, call center agents, and other service providers to ensure proper handling of account activations. The specific steps and timelines for activating accounts may vary depending on the bank's policies and regulatory requirements. The final decision on account activation should be made independently by the bank, without undue delay, after thoroughly investigating the customer's account status. Banks must also report details of activated accounts to the concerned Regional Office of the Reserve Bank within three months from the date of activation. For accounts where there is no positive identification, banks should issue appropriate certificates. In cases of legal disputes, banks should seek a judicial order before proceeding with account activation. Banks should also follow existing guidelines regarding freezing and unfreezing of accounts, ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations. If an account remains inoperable for more than 180 days, banks should conduct due diligence to ascertain the customer's intent before deciding whether to allow account activation. However, banks should not use this timeframe as an excuse to refuse activation of dormant accounts. Banks should also consider offering incentives to customers who bring their accounts back into operation and provide necessary assistance. Banks should not treat the activation of dormant accounts as a one-time event and should instead assess the account's status annually, activating accounts that have been dormant for over two years and have remained inactive for more than six months. Banks should also review their systems to reduce delays in activating accounts and address any issues related to customer service, fraud detection, and recovery measures. Finally, banks should adhere to the guidelines outlined in Annex 2.1 and 2.2 of the Master Direction \u2013 Payment and Settlement Systems (PSS) for electronic payments. Banks should also adhere to the instructions given in the Master Direction \u2013 Payment and Settlement Systems (PSS) regarding the activation of accounts and adhere to the timelines specified therein.
