            "ground_truth_answer": "For banks, liquidity risk involves the potential challenges of converting assets into cash or securing sufficient funding to cover their financial commitments. To manage this risk, banks should thoroughly examine their funding sources and how they use these funds, gain a deep understanding of funding market dynamics, and evaluate the efficacy of their plans for contingent funding needs. It is also important for senior management to be aware of the interdependence between liquidity and capital levels, recognizing that liquidity issues can negatively affect capital adequacy and the reverse is also true. To effectively handle periods of financial instability, banks should hold substantial reserves of easily accessible, high-quality liquid assets that are free from any encumbrances.",
            "generated_answer": "Components of liquidity risk include funding liquidity risk, market liquidity risk, and asset liquidity risk.

An account's asset classification can stay the same or improve after a set time if the borrower meets the requirements for special regulatory consideration and performs as expected.

If a borrower demonstrates improved performance and remains eligible for special regulatory treatment due to continued distressed conditions but meets other criteria like timely interest payments and active participation in resolving financial difficulties, the account may be treated as performing within prudently defined standards. This can lead to its classification under standard risk categories rather than non-performing assets (NPAs).

This classification mandates a 5% provisioning from the date of restructuring until the project's commercial operations commence, or for a period of two years, whichever occurs later.

The restructuring does not exceed 25% of the principal amount of the original term plus interest accrued up to the date of restructuring.\n2. There has been no default by the borrower at the time of restructuring.\n\nThe implications of this classification are that such loans do not require special provisioning under Standardized Approach (SA). However, they must be continuously monitored and upgraded to 'standard' category once the predefined conditions for recovery are met without further enhancements being required from the bank's side.\n\nFor an upgrade to 'standard' status post-restructuring, the following conditions should generally be fulfilled within one year after restructuring:\n- No defaults have occurred since restructuring.\n- Adequate collateral coverage exists.\n- Borrower\u2019s repayment capacity indicates sustainable performance moving forward.\n\nUpon meeting these conditions, the asset can revert back to 'standard' category subject to ongoing scrutiny consistent with regular monitoring requirements applicable to other standard assets.",

A CCF of 50% is applied to these commitments with an original maturity exceeding one year.

It is important to confirm the accuracy of the valuation of goods on invoices and to avoid co-accepting accommodation bills.

Banks should also ensure that the co-acceptance liability aligns with their financial resources, regularly confirm the liabilities of co-accepting banks, maintain detailed records, and notify the co-accepting bank's main office of any disproportionate transactions. Branch managers are required to report co-acceptance commitments to their supervisory offices. Co-acceptances exceeding Rs.10,000 should require dual signatures from bank officials.

            "ground_truth_answer": "For positions hedged using Credit Default Swaps (CDS), a bank can fully offset specific risk capital charges if the values of the CDS and the hedged position demonstrate consistent movement in opposite directions and to the same degree. This typically occurs when the CDS is an exact match for the hedged position. Banks may offset 80% of specific risk capital charges when the values of the CDS and the hedged position move in opposite directions, but not to the same degree. An example is a long cash position hedged by a CDS with an exact match in reference obligation and maturity. This partial offset is conditional on the absence of key features in the CDS that could cause significant price deviations.",
            "generated_answer": "For a full offset of specific risk capital charges, the CDS must meet all the following criteria:\n1. The position being hedged should be within the scope of Basel III framework as specified by the RBI.\n2. The counterparty providing protection through the CDS must have an external credit assessment from at least one recognized rating agency that meets certain minimum standards set by RBI.\n\nA partial offset may occur if the above criteria are met but some limitations exist such as mismatched maturities between the underlying exposure and the CDS contract, differences in notional amounts, etc., where not both parties can fully mitigate their risks simultaneously.

Furthermore, the bank must maintain documented legal opinions confirming that relevant courts and administrative bodies would acknowledge the bank's exposure as a net amount under the laws of the counterparty's jurisdiction, the laws governing the transactions, and the laws governing the netting contract. The bank should also implement procedures for regularly reviewing the legal characteristics of these netting arrangements, considering potential changes in the relevant laws.",

The objective is to confirm that the risk weights allocated according to the Standardised Approach adequately represent the actual risk associated with these exposures. In instances where a bank concludes that the intrinsic risk of an exposure, particularly one lacking a credit rating, is notably greater than the risk weight suggests, the bank is expected to factor in this heightened credit risk in its overall evaluation of capital adequacy. Banks with advanced systems should include risk rating systems, portfolio analysis and aggregation, securitization and complex credit derivatives, and large exposures and risk concentrations in their credit review assessment of capital adequacy.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks must categorize their assets into different risk buckets such as zero-weighted, 20%, 50%, and 100% weighted categories.

            "ground_truth_answer": "In a co-lending agreement, both participating lenders are required to create a jointly approved structure that details how the loan will be monitored and recovered. This structure should clearly define each lender\u2019s roles, processes, and duties in supervising the loan's progress and addressing any defaults or late payments.",
            "generated_answer": "The monitoring and recovery requirements under a co-lending arrangement between banks and NBFCs should be clearly defined in the agreement. Banks and NBFCs involved must jointly monitor the credit quality and performance of the loans. Recovery actions should also be agreed upon and followed by both parties as per the terms of their co-lending agreement. Regular communication and coordination are essential to ensure effective management of non-performing assets.",

            "question": "What is the required regulatory capital treatment when a bank's investments in unconsolidated financial sector entities are more than 10% of the bank's Common Equity Tier 1 capital?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "If a bank's aggregate investments in unconsolidated banking, financial, and insurance entities surpasses 10% of its Common Equity Tier 1 capital, the amount exceeding this threshold is subject to deduction. This deduction follows a corresponding approach, meaning it's applied to the same capital component (Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, or Tier 2) that would be applicable if the bank directly issued the capital. The deduction from each capital tier is proportional to the holdings in that tier as a percentage of total capital holdings. Any shortfall in a specific tier is deducted from the next higher tier.",
            "generated_answer": "The bank must treat such investments as if they were equity exposures under the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based (Advanced IRB) approach. If the bank does not meet this requirement, it shall apply a 250% risk weight to these investments.",
