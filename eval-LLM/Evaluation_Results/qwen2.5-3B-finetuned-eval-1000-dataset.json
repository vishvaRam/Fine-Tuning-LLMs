            "generated_answer": "Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks should set penalties such as foreclosure charges or prepayment penalties after considering whether these charges will adequately compensate them for any losses resulting from servicing the borrower's account. The amount charged may be lower if it constitutes both an economic cost and an incentive against premature repayment. These penalty charges cannot exceed 3% above the bank-accepted rate for overdue bills accepted by the banks without discounting them; however, no punitive charge can be levied before three days following dishonor or non-payment due to insufficient funds. Banks also need to maintain proper records regarding payments made towards dues upon cancellation of overdraft facilities granted to borrowers beyond statutory limits, including amounts reduced during periods where interest was automatically computed at the sanctioned rate plus risk premium because of absence of monthly statements.",

It ensures separation between management duties and regular business operations for fraud prevention. The structure should also allow for flexible delegation of authority to streamline decision-making processes and enhance efficiency across different departments. Adequate controls over cash handling, loans, investments, advances, off-balance sheet exposures, and inter-branch transactions must be established through robust systems like computerized record keeping, dual authorization, and proper custody arrangements. Branch managers have oversight responsibilities regarding employees' access rights and ensure compliance with regulatory guidelines concerning insider trading, customer transaction records accessibility, and non-deposit taking powers against unauthorized individuals or entities. Employees involved in credit evaluation or loan granting should not concurrently handle bookkeeping accounts pertaining to these credits until their role has been formally terminated.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "In cases where a borrower has credit arrangements with several banks, and only one of these arrangements has been externally rated, other banks may use this rating for their own unrated credit arrangements. However, this is permissible only if the unrated claims from these other banks have the same or higher seniority compared to the rated debt. Additionally, the unrated claims cannot mature later than the rated claim. If the External Credit Assessment Institution (ECAI) does not reveal which bank and specific credit arrangement it has rated, then no bank is allowed to use that rating; instead, they must apply the risk weights applicable to unrated exposures.",
            "generated_answer": "When multiple banks provide credit facilities to a borrower, each bank's rating may not be considered when determining if there is systemic risk due to interlocking credit. However, all banks must obtain mutually acceptable ratings from recognized credit rating agencies regarding their respective exposures within the consolidated exposure limits sanctioned by lenders' boards or senior management committees; otherwise, individual assessments should be made without referencing the ratings of other institutions involved in financing the borrower. Banks using these agency ratings should maintain records to establish consistency between the assigned ratings and the underlying data supporting them, as well as ensure strict confidentiality of confidential information provided during the assignment process. If any doubt arises about the validity of such agency ratings, they can be verified through independent credit analysis conducted independently by both parties before finalizing business decisions.

Furthermore, the bank may be required to publicly disclose that it was found to have provided this non-contractual support, in addition to the resulting increase in the capital charge.

The bank has the option to adjust for available financial collateral. To mitigate the effect on quarterly earnings, the bank is permitted to distribute the provisions over a maximum of four quarters, beginning with the quarter in which the fraud was identified.

            "ground_truth_answer": "For restructured accounts, interest income recognition depends on the asset classification. If the account is classified as a standard asset, interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. If classified as a nonperforming asset (NPA), interest income is recognized only when it is received in cash.",
            "generated_answer": "When an account is upgraded from a NPA status back to 'standard', interest income can be recognized normally. However, if there's no payment received beyond the due date stipulated in the restructuring agreement for 180 days continuously, the asset will revert to NPA status, and normal provisioning rules apply, while only accrued interest up to ten days before the application of fresh provisioning rate can be taken into account when calculating gross profit/net profit. Interest above this limit must not be reckoned until actual receipt occurs. If payments resume within 15 days following remission of funds upon realization, the account may again qualify for upgrade to standard category; otherwise, it remains in the same loan classification as at the time of recognition.",

This also applies when interest or other charges fall into arrears, even if they were paid later within 90 days from their payment due dates; these payments only serve to extinguish the principal debt, not cover the penal interest charged during the deferral period. However, an advance may be considered current even while prosecution proceedings are pending against borrowers who have defaulted in paying amounts secured by hypothecation or pledge, provided that adequate security exists before initiating legal action. In cases where loans payable through periodic installments require partial payments without altering the installment schedule's timeline, such as drawing down advances against accruing interest at intervals exceeding three months but less than six months following disbursement, it should still qualify as a current account upon receipt of funds.

            "ground_truth_answer": "In banking, a 'loss asset' refers to an asset for which a bank, its internal or external auditors, or the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) during an inspection, has identified a loss. This loss, however, has not been completely written off the bank's books. Such assets are deemed uncollectible and of negligible value, making their classification as a bankable asset unwarranted, even if some potential for salvage or recovery remains.",
            "generated_answer": "An account classified as loss by its regulator or custodian constitutes an immediate write-off. A borrower's entire exposure becomes immediately uncollectible if there has been no payment for over 180 days from due dates specified under credit facilities; this also applies where payments received do not cover outstanding dues. If overdue amounts remain unpaid despite efforts like legal proceedings against guarantors or security holders after more than 90 days but less than 180 days, it can be classified as a doubtful asset rather than a loss asset. However, clear evidence exists showing that full collectibility depends solely upon continued effort without any assurance of recovery beyond reasonable doubt. For government-guaranteed accounts, being overdue for up to six months does not automatically trigger classification as a loss asset unless these guidelines suggest otherwise. Banks must adhere strictly to prescribed norms regarding written-off accounts maintained separately according to their maturity periods.",

The reason for this is to alleviate the financial strain on farmers when they seek credit for agricultural needs, especially given the increasing inflation and costs of agricultural inputs.",
            "generated_answer": "To facilitate easier access to credit for farmers, banks have been directed to set up State Level Sub-Committees to review issues concerning agriculture. Based on their recommendations, an extension of time was granted until June 30, 2047, allowing direct benefit transfers under MUDRA to be applicable even without requiring collateral or margin from borrowers for crop raising advances up to \u20b95 lakh per borrower within a given year. This measure aims to reduce the burden on farmers by eliminating the need for additional margins like crops or land as security when availing of such loans.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "The penalty interest rates imposed on banks for failing to meet their reserve requirements are either the bank rate plus 3.0 percentage points or the bank rate plus 5.0 percentage points, contingent on the duration of the deficiency. Presently, these rates correspond to 9.75 percent or 11.75 percent, respectively.",
            "generated_answer": "The penal interest rate applied by regulatory authorities against banks not meeting reserve requirement obligations varies depending on how long the shortfalls persist. For a period up to 60 calendar days from notification of non-compliance, the rate is the bank's CRR plus 2%. Beyond this timeframe but within one year, it increases to the bank's CRR plus 4%. Over one year without compliance action being taken or paid off through deposit absorption, the penalty escalates to the bank's CRR plus 8%.\n\nAs per recent updates as of March 31, 2025, these penalties have been modified again: The rate for periods exceeding six months and less than one year is the bank's CRR plus 6%, while that beyond one year and calculated quarterly will be the bank's CRR plus 9%.

            "ground_truth_answer": "A revised repayment plan for a project loan, necessitated by an expansion in the project's scope and size prior to the commencement of commercial operations, will not be classified as a restructuring if the augmented cost surpasses 25% of the initial expenditure. Furthermore, this classification requires the lending bank to re-evaluate the project's financial sustainability, ensuring that the revised credit rating does not fall more than one level below the original rating.",
            "generated_answer": "If modifications to a project loan's repayment schedule occur because there has been an upward revision in the scope or size of activities undertaken within the original project boundaries before its commencement of operations for generating cash flows, this modification will not be treated as a 'restructuring'. However, if such modifications arise from additions to projects that were taken over by existing entities through amalgamation or takeover bids, they would also fall under non-restructuring.

Banks should consider diversification, assess correlations within and between different risks, and provide justification for diversification benefits between legal entities, including the ability to freely move capital during times of financial stress. This overall assessment should also take into account any uncertainties present in modeling and any weaknesses identified in risk management practices.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks must assess their overall level of risk by combining all relevant data into an assessment that adequately captures the interrelationships among risks. This process involves considering how various sources contribute to total firm-wide exposure across credit, market, operational, liquidity, strategic, reputational, legal, and other types of risk. While quantitative techniques can provide useful insights about particular sets of exposures or strategies within a business line, they cannot replace qualitative judgments regarding cross-line exposures and hidden dependencies.

Given the current Bank Rate, these calculations lead to penalty interest rates of 9.50% or 11.50%, respectively.",
            "generated_answer": "When calculating penalties for not meeting reserve requirements, if the shortfall isn't covered by adjustments from other regulatory instruments or surplus balances, an additional 2% per annum above the bank's prevailing borrowing rate under CRR/SLR norms must be applied. The penalized borrowing rate equals either the Overnight Repo Rate plus 400 basis points, or the bank's Cost of Funds measured annually as per statutory prescriptions, whichever is higher.\n\nFor Scheduled Commercial Banks excluding Regional Rural Banks and Small Finance Banks, this results in rates ranging from approximately 9.58% to 13.76%.

When equities serve as the underlying asset, the capital charge relies on delta-weighted positions, integrated into the market risk assessment, with each national market treated independently. Conversely, for options involving foreign exchange or gold, the capital charge calculation incorporates the net delta-based equivalent of these options to gauge exposure within the respective currency or gold position.",
            "generated_answer": "When calculating the risk-weighted capital charges for banks involved in equity-related derivatives like stock index futures, interest rate swaps where one party's payment depends on an underlying bond price, or currency forwards involving government securities as reference instruments, banks must use proprietary pricing models that adhere to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The bank should also provide details of any third-party model usage. Banks without internal derivative-pricing systems may utilize approved external modeling firms' prices; these firm-specific quotes serve as inputs into the bank's netting-set valuation process. For over-the-counter (OTC) agreements not covered by IFRS guidelines, such as forward-rate agreements referenced to long-term floating-rate bonds outside standard coupon schedules, banks can employ their own hedging positions to calculate gains/losses under specific scenarios. In cases lacking direct hedge information, banks have discretion regarding calculation methodologies.\n\nFor investments in securitization exposures where credit risks arise from factors other than changes in market liquidity conditions, the volatility capture approach shall be applied during periods exceeding three months following the issuance date. This involves marking-to-market valuations using widely recognized indices reflecting similar maturity corporate debt issues within relevant sectors, adjusted according to publicly available ratings agency assessments provided at loan inception or shortly thereafter.

            "ground_truth_answer": "For bank-financed industrial projects or agricultural plantations that include a moratorium period for interest payments, the point at which interest is considered 'due' is shifted to the end of this moratorium or gestation period. Consequently, an account's classification as a non-performing asset (NPA) is not determined by the initial debit date of the interest.

            "ground_truth_answer": "According to banking regulations, the classification of an asset as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA) should primarily be based on its recovery record. Banks are instructed not to classify an advance as NPA merely because of temporary issues such as insufficient drawing power or non-renewal of limits. However, if there's a risk of loss or uncertainty regarding the advance's recoverability, it should be treated as an NPA.",
            "generated_answer": "When determining if an advance or investment becomes a non-performing asset, banks primarily consider whether principal or interest payments have been overdue by more than 90 days. However, other factors like inherent weaknesses may also lead to NPA classification even without payment overdues. For example, advances against shares, debentures, or bonds will only become NPAs due to failure to receive coupon or principal payments after specific dates.",

A bank might choose to honor its liabilities to safeguard its reputation, even if it strains its liquidity. This is particularly true for liabilities that are part of the bank's regulatory capital, like hybrid or subordinated debt, and can negatively impact the bank's capital position.",
            "generated_answer": "Reputational risk may cause banks to withdraw from markets or cease providing certain services. This withdrawal could lead directly to an asset loss by reducing revenues for non-performing assets like loans and indirectly through increased funding costs due to negative perceptions affecting debt instruments such as deposits and securities issued by the bank. Additionally, it might hinder fundraising efforts from both primary and secondary markets, potentially resulting in declines in share prices.

The RBI does not aim to match the regulatory minimum Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) with what the ICAAP suggests. Instead, the RBI wants banks to prove that their ICAAP is tailored to their specific characteristics, such as size, how complex they are, their operational reach, and their risk profile. It also expects the ICAAP to accurately reflect the bank's capital needs.",
            "generated_answer": "The RBI may use the SREP process as an opportunity for dialogue between the RBI and banks regarding ICAAP processes. The RBI should also communicate its expectations from banks' ICAAP procedures relative to their role in fulfilling regulatory capital requirements through both direct communication during supervisory evaluations and within public statements about expected standards. Furthermore, when assessing banks\u2019 compliance with risk-based capital adequacy requirements, the RBI will compare these assessments against published results pertaining to major risks like credit concentration, securitization exposures, trading book leverage, concentrations in private sector lending by regulated entities, fair valuation challenges around model performance, large exposure limits breaches, unresolved legal/contractual disputes involving significant amounts due or payable by the entity, reputational concerns raised by market participants that affect funding costs, etc., which serve as key indicators of whether the ICAAP adequately captures material risk exposures.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "For a bank using a Credit Default Swap (CDS) to hedge its financial risks, the CDS contract needs to directly obligate the protection seller to cover a specific, defined exposure. The CDS must be non-cancellable by the protection seller unless the premium is unpaid. The protection seller cannot increase the cost or cancel the cover due to the deteriorating credit quality. Payment by the protection provider must be guaranteed if the original borrower defaults, based on credit events that include failure to pay under the terms of the hedged obligation.",
            "generated_answer": "To be considered a valid hedging instrument, banks using Credit Default Swaps should ensure that their exposure to the reference entity or underlying asset isn't extinguished by maturity. Additionally, the credit event defined within the CDS contract must have sufficient certainty relative to standard definitions used across similar transactions to prevent disputes regarding its occurrence. The swap should also not involve buying protection against more than one risk driver simultaneously; if an issuer has multiple risks affecting it concurrently, each risk can only be hedged through separate swaps addressing specific events like default, restructuring, or liquidation.

            "question": "What actions should a bank undertake if its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio declines below 8 percent but stays above 6.125 percent?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "If a bank's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio decreases to below 8 percent, yet remains above 6.125 percent, the bank should focus on increasing its balance sheet by obtaining new equity from current shareholders, the market, or through retained earnings. New exposures may be taken up to the amount of existing ones that have been amortized; however, any unavoidable increase in exposures should be offset by promptly decreasing other exposures. The bank is also required to keep comprehensive records of these transactions for review by auditors and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) inspectors.",
            "generated_answer": "When a bank's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio falls between 8% and 6.125%, it must take prompt corrective action as defined by extant prudential norms regarding capital adequacy for commercial banks under Basel III standards. Additionally, additional deductions from CET1 may be applied according to Section 40(7A)(iii), which involves deducting half of any increase in Other Comprehensive Income that results from increases in gross investment income or decreases in loss provisions during this period; these losses can only be deducted once the bank has met regulatory requirements concerning provisioning against such investments. This deduction reduces eligible CRAR further until reaching zero when no deductions remain. The other half of the increase in OCI beyond what was allowed before being reduced will then qualify for deferred recognition.",

The lending bank should apply the appropriate risk weight applicable to the guaranteeing entity. These exposures must also be included within the inter-bank exposure limits established by the lending bank\u2019s Board of Directors. A specific sub-limit should be set for longer-term exposures due to their higher risk profile. Regular monitoring is crucial to ensure compliance with prudential limits and single borrower limits set by both the lending bank\u2019s board and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).",
            "generated_answer": "When extending fund-based or non-fund-based facilities where the borrower's liability is guaranteed by another bank or financial institution, banks must ensure that their total outstanding exposure does not exceed 5% of Tier I capital. Within this overall limit, exposures arising due to guarantees issued as part of support measures during crisis management should be excluded. Banks also need to obtain prior approval from the regulator before sanctioning any additional facility beyond the prescribed ceiling after taking up existing commitments under schemes like AIFLI/SILPI etc., ensuring compliance remains within regulatory norms post-approval. Additionally, lenders should have an agreement with the guarantor outlining how disagreements over interpretation/guarantee fulfillment would be resolved. The extent of supervisory review will depend upon whether there was adherence to prudential norms while issuing the guarantee, but if doubts exist about honoring the commitment at some future date, it may necessitate more rigorous monitoring rather than being treated normally as standard trade finance transactions.",

Therefore, guarantees supporting activities lacking self-sustaining funding or promoting general 'development' without explicit credit needs from specific borrowers cannot be issued. However, when lending directly to Housing Development Corporations/Boards/Housing Boards set up under public-private partnerships where only infrastructure development costs are financed and there isn't an ongoing financing requirement, such as toll-ways/high ways etc., banks may issue non-fund based facilities including guarantees against defaults due to inadequate maintenance of roads/buildings/towers/metros/hospitals/etc. These exceptions allow for bank-guaranteed maintenance schemes even if the organization lacks direct funds but has been established to undertake long-term projects.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "For the purpose of calculating the capital charge related to market risk, when dealing with interest rate derivatives, banks are required to convert these derivatives into positions based on the relevant underlying instrument. The capital charge should be computed using the market value of the principal amount of the underlying instrument or the notional underlying amount. In situations where the apparent notional amount differs from the effective notional amount, banks are required to use the effective notional amount for the calculation.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks must utilize an approved model or system that converts all interest rate derivative contracts into positions equivalent to the underlying bond. This conversion helps in accurately measuring potential losses due to changes in yield curves associated solely with the credit quality of the issuer. The bank's management bears full responsibility for ensuring this process adequately addresses its specific operational complexities. Banks can choose their own methodology as long as it adheres to these principles. For instance, if a bank has fully hedged floating-rate debt exposure using swaps where the reference/benchmark security matches exactly what would be issued by another entity under similar conditions, no further adjustments are necessary. However, differences between actual/expected coupon payments may still trigger additional supervisory review assessments regarding 'enhanced marking-to-market'.

The amount recognized is the total minority interest less any surplus Common Equity Tier 1 capital held by the subsidiary that is attributable to the minority shareholders. Surplus Common Equity Tier 1 capital is determined by subtracting the lower of two amounts from the subsidiary's total Common Equity Tier 1 capital. These amounts are: either the subsidiary's minimum Common Equity Tier 1 requirement plus its capital conservation buffer (which totals 8.0% of its risk-weighted assets), or the portion of the consolidated group's minimum requirement plus buffer (8.0% of the consolidated risk-weighted assets) that is applicable to the subsidiary. The portion of the surplus attributable to minority shareholders is calculated by multiplying this surplus amount by the percentage of Common Equity Tier 1 capital that they hold in the subsidiary.",
            "generated_answer": "When calculating Common Equity Tier 1 capital at an entity level before deducting goodwill and other intangibles or including potential future contributions from subsidiaries that have not yet been recognized as investments in their own accounts, banks may recognize minority interests stemming from both perpetual non-cumulative preference shares (\"PNCPS\") mandatorily converted into ordinary share capital upon conversion trigger event and free reserves arising out of profit appropriation. The amount included should be net of any regulatory adjustments and deductions applicable under Basel III rules pertaining to instrument-specific deduction requirements applied against CET-1 capital after loss absorption mechanisms have fully taken effect; however, if there's insufficient room within the minimum requirement for CET-1 without adding these amounts, they can be added gross but then reduced accordingly when computing the overall minimum regulatory capital ratio. Minority interest due to PNCPS which qualifies for preferential treatment will also qualify for such same preferential treatment while being computed together alongwith eligible Free Reserves for meeting the total CRAR objective of Cet-1 of min.4% & Total Capital Ratio of Min .9%. For example, where a regulated entity has a 20 percent stake in another legal entity holding $8 million worth of equity capital, only up to $6 million could be considered towards CET-1 capital depending on existing CET-1 allocation ceilings per relevant regulatory guidance.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "To reduce regional differences in priority sector lending, the RBI uses an incentive structure based on districts' per capita priority sector credit flow. Districts with lower per capita PSL (less than \u20b99,000) get a higher weight of 125% on incremental priority sector credit. Districts with higher per capita PSL (greater than \u20b942,000) receive a lower weight of 90%. Districts not falling into either category are assigned a weightage of 100%.",
            "generated_answer": "To address regional disparities in priority sector credit flows, districts can receive an additional 2% of their target as incentive if they have lower credit penetration. Conversely, districts exceeding ceilings by more than 5 percentage points will face a penalty of 3%. A district's total eligible CRAR-based reward or penalty under Priority Sector Lending Incentive Scheme may be capped at 100% above/below the applicable ceiling after adjustment.

To ensure compliance, the repayment process must be structured so that funds are transferred directly from the employer's bank account to the Regulated Entity (RE) providing the loan.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks must ensure that any contract between an employee-borrower using a Lending Service Provider (LSP) for repayment management does not give the LSP control or influence over the movement of funds. The bank should provide sufficient safeguards against such manipulation when considering loan proposals involving this type of service arrangement. Banks need to establish clear guidelines regarding who can request these services from the approved LSP(s). If there has been no activity within 90 days after requesting access, banks will disable further requests without prior approval; however, individual employees may still be allowed one more chance if contacted directly by the employer upon review before another 90-day period begins. Requests beyond two instances require a justification deemed acceptable by the bank at the time of consideration. Banks must also verify compliance with regulatory instructions regarding unsecured loans granted through online lending platforms (OLPs), including strict adherence to asset classification standards under Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning (IRACP) norms as per Section 28A(1)(a) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.

Additionally, both obligations must pertain to the same legal entity and include legally enforceable cross-default or cross-acceleration clauses.",

Protection from CDS cannot exceed that offered by senior unsecured claims on such entities but may rank equally as senior secured debt if meeting additional requirements set forth by regulatory authorities.

If the asset was classified as 'standard' after the initial restructuring, it is downgraded to 'substandard' upon the second restructuring. If the asset was initially classified as 'substandard' or 'doubtful' and is then restructured again, its asset classification is based on the date it originally became a Non-Performing Asset (NPA). However, these restructured advances can be upgraded to 'standard' after a period of one year from the date of the first interest payment or principal payment, whichever is earlier, is due under the terms of the latest or current restructuring package, provided the performance remains satisfactory during the observation period.",

However, there's no change required for other assets that were previously classified as standard when undergoing additional restructuring. Restructuring documentation from earlier periods does not affect the current or future creditworthiness assessment of these accounts.

Specifically, if trades are not cleared via a qualifying central counterparty, the received cash should not be segregated. Furthermore, the variation margin must be both calculated and exchanged on a daily basis, utilizing mark-to-market valuation. The cash variation margin should be denominated in the same currency used for settling the derivative contract.

            "ground_truth_answer": "If a bank provides post-shipment export credit to countries under the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) cover, and the EXIM Bank offers a guarantee-cum-refinance program, the credit will not be classified as a non-performing asset (NPA) for classification and provisioning, provided that payment has been received from EXIM Bank.",

This facilitates an automatic one-year moratorium period under the ECGC scheme. However, if there's no evidence that these credits were used specifically for repayment after being recognized as such by the ECGC during loan sanction up to six months later, then the bank account becomes overdue beyond three months without repayment following standard procedures when classified as NPA.",

Furthermore, banks usually need an affidavit where the applicant declares that the construction will strictly follow the sanctioned plan. The applicant also commits to obtaining a completion certificate within three months of finishing construction. If the applicant fails to provide the completion certificate within the stipulated time, the bank reserves the right to demand immediate repayment of the entire loan amount, including all accrued interest and associated charges.",

Additionally, if applicable, permission should be obtained from relevant authorities such as the Subordinate Development Officer under the Urban Planning Act regarding construction within specified areas. Banks also request certificates confirming compliance with all statutory prescriptions issued by competent local authorities concerning water supply connections, drainage systems, garbage disposal facilities, etc., along with completion certificates after structural work is completed and necessary permissions have been secured. If there's a pending development plan application, it must accompany the loan application.

If the borrower meets the requirements for these concessions and maintains satisfactory performance, the asset classification may either remain unchanged or improve after a set duration. Conversely, if the borrower does not meet the eligibility criteria or their performance is not satisfactory, the asset will be downgraded to substandard or doubtful classifications, depending on the length of the overdue period.",
            "generated_answer": "When determining whether a restructuring involves granting special regulatory consideration, lenders should consider both the borrower's pre-existing creditworthiness and their post-restructuring payment history. If borrowers demonstrate satisfactory performance during the monitoring period after restructuring, they may be eligible for readmission under standard bank credit categories or have existing overdue loans downgraded from substandard to 'Standard'. However, if there is any indication that default might recur despite the restructuring package or if sufficient time hasn't elapsed for evaluation due to hardship circumstances, such accounts can remain in the same category until at least six months following the next date of compounding interest.",

Instead, the accrued interest should be recorded separately in an 'Interest Receivable Account' on the asset side of the balance sheet, with a matching entry in an 'Overdue Interest Reserve Account' on the liabilities side.

            "ground_truth_answer": "If a bank categorizes a borrower's loan as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA), the mark-to-market (MTM) values of all associated derivative exposures must be managed in the same way as the loan. This means that any realized or settled amount from a specific derivative transaction is also classified as NPA. The MTM values of any other derivative exposures should be accounted for in a similar manner.",
            "generated_answer": "When a bank classifies a loan or advance it has granted to an entity marked against as a non-performing asset (NPA), all subsequent changes in the market value of derivatives held by that bank relative to their respective underlyings must be reflected through a corresponding accounting entry. This means that any increase or decrease in MTM arising from fluctuations in underlying markets should be transferred to 'Over-Crystallized/Under-Crystallized Account' or 'Suspense Account \u2013 NPA', depending on whether crystallization has occurred at the time of recognition or not yet achieved.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "When approving loans, particularly small value loans such as personal loans, Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) are expected to have a clearly defined approval process. This process should assess the borrower's repayment capacity based on their cash flows. The interest rates applied to these loans should incorporate a risk premium that is deemed appropriate and supportable.",
            "generated_answer": "When determining whether an individual borrower should be considered eligible for a sanctioned limit or not, any credit facility from other lending institutions must also be disclosed. UCBs should assess applications thoroughly at branch/board level meetings, ensuring they meet established criteria before approving them. Additionally, there's no requirement for borrowers to prepay their debts upon receiving windfall gains; however, lenders may consider implementing a moratorium period during significant celebrations like marriages or childbirth. The sanctioning authority can set its own internal limits regarding premature debt repayment without penalty, considering factors such as the bank's viability, economic conditions, risk profile, funds position, etc., subject to board approval. While direct subsidies generally don't qualify as income for calculating Gross Disbursement Liabilities (GDL), indirect benefits like government schemes can contribute to the computation of GDL.

Furthermore, a minimum of 10% of the total of the outstanding principal debt plus any capitalized interest approved within the restructuring plan must be repaid.

The provisioning rates are as follows: 0.25% for farm credit to agricultural activities, individual housing loans, and loans to Small and Micro Enterprises (SMEs); 1.00% for advances to the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) sector; 0.75% for advances to the Commercial Real Estate Residential Housing (CRE RH) sector; a specific rate for housing loans extended at teaser rates; a rate as per the prudential norms for restructured advances; 5% for advances restructured and classified as standard according to the Reserve Bank of India (Relief Measures by Banks in Areas affected by Natural Calamities) Directions 2018; and 0.40% for all other loans and advances not categorized above.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks should provision at specific annualized percentages for government-guaranteed claims without collateral due within one year; they also need to provide 5% annually on 'all other' loans or advances. The provisioning requirement for restructured accounts varies depending on how many times restructuring has occurred; it's lower if no restructuring has taken place compared to multiple instances. For non-performing assets, provisions range from 20% upwards, up to 100%, contingent upon their classification status as well as any previous adjustments like haircuts applied during asset classification. Banks facing difficulties in classifying an advance as either NPFA or NPA may provision between 20-40%. Finally, investments in AFS/Gilt/Safekeeping accounts require provisioning according to residual maturities: less than 1 year requires 8%, while over 3 years demands only 5%.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "For calculating specific risk capital charges, a bank can fully offset these charges for credit default swap (CDS) positions that are hedged by other CDS positions when the values of the two offsetting positions (the long and short positions) consistently exhibit inverse movements of similar magnitude. This typically occurs when the CDS positions are completely identical. A partial offset of 80% of the specific risk capital charges is permitted when the values of the hedging and hedged positions move in opposite directions, but not to a similar extent. An example includes hedging a long cash position with a CDS that precisely matches the reference or deliverable obligation and maturity of the cash position.",

A debtor company includes those with current or past loan/investment exposure within the last year. If an AIF already invested in by a regulated entity makes a downstream investment in a debtor company, the regulated entity must liquidate its investment in the AIF within 30 days.

The CDS agreement must establish a direct claim against the protection seller, clearly specify a particular exposure, and be non-cancellable, except in cases of unpaid premiums. The agreement terms should prevent the protection seller from unilaterally terminating the coverage or raising the price because of declining creditworthiness. Furthermore, the CDS must be unconditional, obligating the protection seller to provide timely payment should the original counterparty default.",
            "generated_answer": "When a bank uses a Credit Default Swap (CDS) as part of its hedging strategy, there must be direct legal connection between the reference or deliverable obligation and the underlying exposure being hedged. Additionally, banks need to have written procedures approved by their board that ensure timely delivery of replacement obligations upon default or potential default of the original reference/deliverable obligation due to event-driven losses. These obligations should represent perfect substitutes for the initial reference/delivery obligation without any restrictions imposed solely because they replace an issuer whose debt has previously experienced non-viability indicators leading to a resolution under Chapter 15 of Title 11 of the United States Code.

            "generated_answer": "Banks should consider premium or discounts arising from being out-of-the-money when valuing swaps. For forward contracts like forwards, futures, and foreign exchange options where pricing models exist for both sides of the contract; any mark-to-market loss due to volatility can be deducted as an 'economically non-collateralized adjustment'. Banks may also deduct expected future declines in fair values of over-the-counter derivative assets attributable to declining credit quality ('credit heding discount') if treated rigorously under Pillar 2. If collateral agreements provide for marking collaterals to market valuations during periods of market stress, this effect needs to be taken into account. The impact of indexation changes resulting from fluctuations in underlying asset prices must also be considered by adjusting each side's gross positive change in accordance with its notional exposure to that risk factor.",

Exposures are typically not classified as CRE if the repayment primarily depends on operating profits, the provision of services, or the volume of tourist visits. Conversely, an exposure is generally categorized as CRE if the repayment is mainly derived from lease payments, rental revenues, or proceeds from the sale of assets.",

During their tenure as a statutory auditor, the audit firm can offer services that don't typically create conflicts of interest, as determined by the bank's Board or Audit Committee. Permissible special assignments, unlikely to be considered conflicts, encompass tax audits, audits of interim financial statements, and the issuance of certificates mandated by legal or regulatory bodies.",

Consequently, the run-off factor becomes 7.5% for stable retail deposits with IMB and 12.5% for less stable retail deposits with IMB.",
            "generated_answer": "When determining a bank's Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), banks must account for potential runoff from both non-retail and retail funding sources. For retail deposit categories where Internet or Mobile Banking channels provide alternative funding if face-to-face branches close down unexpectedly, no additional LCR cushion needs to be considered beyond standard allowances made under Pillar 1 liquidity risk monitoring tools due to losses expected during an SFP event caused by customers transferring funds through these electronic means instead of visiting physical branches.",

Any discrepancy between the security's acquisition cost and its fair value is immediately accounted for in the bank's Profit and Loss Statement.

The bank's management team determines how much of its owned stock can be included when calculating net worth against the state government portion resulting from such sales. Any increase in book value due to upward revaluations beyond this point will not contribute towards meeting regulatory capital requirements but may reduce losses during downward adjustments of reserves.

This factor is based on the number of business days elapsed since the settlement date without payment. Banks are required to monitor the overdue period from the agreed settlement date to ascertain the correct capital charge.",

            "generated_answer": "Banks must analyze underlying risk exposures when issuing or purchasing structured finance securities. They also need strong procedures for monitoring concentrations in securitization transactions and ensuring sufficient management attention. Senior management decisions regarding new product launches and investments involving existing products require careful consideration of legal opinions concerning novation agreements. Banks should avoid participating as investors in instruments where they have lent money if that lending forms part of a credit enhancement mechanism within securitizations. Additionally, explicit consent from borrowers/constituents is necessary before approving any transaction that could impair their ability to grant fresh financing or renew existing facilities to support issuance of these instruments by them.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "The inclusion of Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI) within a bank's Tier I capital is capped at 15% of the total Tier I capital. This limit encompasses any outstanding Innovative Perpetual Debt Instruments (IPDI) as well. A bank can exceed this 15% limit if the PDI issuance is part of a revival or financial reconstruction plan, subject to prior approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).",

However, if an additional PDI framework has been approved as part of the Basel III Capital Framework review process, banks may count such instruments towards their Tier I capital without exceeding this overall ceiling once they reach full implementation stage.

            "ground_truth_answer": "For the calculation of a bank's Common Equity Tier 1 capital, all debit valuation adjustments (DVAs) must be deducted. This deduction applies to all DVAs, whether they result from changes in the bank's own credit risk profile or from other market variables, including the initial DVA amount when a new trade begins. Banks are required to account for losses that reflect the credit risk of the counterparty, known as credit valuation adjustments (CVAs). However, they cannot recognize gains associated with their own credit risk.",
            "generated_answer": "When calculating Common Equity Tier 1 capital, banks must deduct all debit valuation adjustments (DVs) from their gross DVA liability. This means that any losses due to fluctuations in market prices for assets or liabilities should be deducted rather than recognized as an expense during the period they occur. While banks typically recognize credit loss exposures through\u8ba1\u63d0(credit impairment provisions), DVAs represent non-cash charges linked to changes in fair values without resulting in immediate cash outflows; therefore, these should also not be booked in Profit & Loss account but treated net of corresponding deductions like unrealized GPAR reversals and foreign currency translation reserves at the ultimate common equity level after all regulatory haircuts have been applied. Banks may continue to disclose individual components of DVA separately within 'Other Regulatory Disclosures - Item 9: Contingent Liabilities \u2013 Amounts Imprest' until such time as national accounting standards require expensing of non-performing investments upon revaluation.",

Consequently, stable retail deposits with IMB will have a run-off factor of 7.5 percent, while less stable deposits with IMB will have a run-off factor of 12.5 percent.",

Banks should not reject loan applications from SHGs simply because family members of individual SHG members have defaulted on loans.

The variable component is a percentage of the amount involved in the violation, starting at 0.050% for violations lasting less than a year and increasing to 0.075% for violations lasting five years or longer. Notably, if the violation involves issuing guarantees to obtain loans that are then reinvested in India, the potential penalty may be tripled.",

Any changes to the EMI amount or the loan's duration due to interest rate adjustments must be communicated to the borrower. Borrowers must be offered the option to switch to a fixed interest rate, according to a Board-approved policy that specifies the number of permitted switches during the loan term. Borrowers also have the option to increase their EMI, extend the loan tenure, or combine both approaches. They can also make partial or full prepayments at any time during the loan, in accordance with existing regulations regarding foreclosure charges. All charges associated with switching from a floating to a fixed rate, as well as any other service or administrative fees, must be clearly disclosed in the loan sanction letter and whenever such charges are modified. Institutions must also guarantee that extending the loan's term does not result in negative amortization. Furthermore, borrowers are entitled to receive a quarterly statement outlining the principal and interest recovered, the EMI amount, the remaining number of EMIs, and the annualized interest rate.",

This exclusion, which aligns with capital conservation buffer regulations, remains in effect until the bank's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio reaches 8% without including the replenished equity. Once the bank achieves a CET1 ratio of 8% independently of the replenished capital, the replenished equity can be included for all purposes, including dividend payouts.",

            "question": "Why are advances restructured, and what are the main points to consider when deciding if an advance should have its terms modified?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "The goal of modifying the terms of advances is to maintain the economic value of businesses that can succeed, while also preventing the indefinite continuation of problematic accounts. This requires carefully evaluating whether the business can survive, quickly spotting any weaknesses, and putting modification plans into action promptly. Modification should only be done if the borrower's ability to pay back the loan is clear and there is good reason to believe they will pay according to the new terms. Things like Return on Capital Employed, Debt Service Coverage Ratio, and the gap between the Internal Rate of Return and Cost of Funds should be taken into account. Accounts that are not likely to succeed should not have their terms modified, and instead, efforts to recover the funds should be prioritized.",
            "generated_answer": "When determining whether an advance's terms need modification due to restructuring, banks must ensure that the borrower cannot repay from their own resources. If repayment depends on external funds like sales or investments beyond control, the bank may modify the terms before closure, provided it remains satisfied about recovery prospects after such measures as necessary for revival or cash infusion into operations.",

This decision depends on the bank's assessment after considering any changes made during construction and whether the revised date still makes economic sense for the project. A change in management does not automatically trigger this provision; it requires careful consideration by both the regulator and lenders regarding viability.

            "ground_truth_answer": "An asset is categorized as doubtful if it has remained in the substandard category for a period of 12 months. These assets display the same weaknesses as those classified as substandard. However, the collection or liquidation of a doubtful asset is considered highly questionable and improbable based on the information currently available.",
            "generated_answer": "An advance account can be categorized as doubtful if it remains in either 'sub-standard' or 'standard' categories for more than 180 days. The key characteristic defining these accounts involves their capacity for full repayment through normal operations without requiring any concessions from the lender. When such repayment becomes questionable due to inherent weaknesses like uncertainties regarding recovery prospects, borrower insolvency, existing arrears exceeding permissible limits, weak management, legal obstacles preventing cash repayment, inability to liquidate assets quickly enough to meet obligations, lack of adequate security coverage compared to outstanding advances, or other factors indicating difficulty in complete settlement within reasonable timeframes at current rates, the account should be classified under this category. Additionally, exposure where there has been non-recovery beyond prescribed moratorium periods may also qualify for doubtfulness classification depending on individual circumstances analyzed by lenders during credit review processes conducted according to Board-approved guidelines aimed at ensuring consistent application across banks and loan portfolios while considering specific business realities.",

Instead, these policies should emphasize long-term capital preservation and the financial stability of the institution, incorporating risk-adjusted performance evaluations. Furthermore, sufficient transparency regarding compensation policies should be ensured for all stakeholders.",
            "generated_answer": "To ensure strong incentive alignment between employee interests and that of shareholders, compensation policies should be designed to foster an active role by employees in promoting sound firm-wide risk management. This includes avoiding excessive deferred payments or incentives tied to risky short-term results. Compensation levels must also reflect each individual's responsibilities and contributions to the organization; bonuses should not be overly generous relative to total remuneration packages. A significant portion of compensation beyond base pay should be performance-based, linked directly to achieving specific risk-adjusted objectives like ROE/ROA, return on equity, revenue growth from high-risk business lines, reduction in operational risks/rejections at settlement level, adherence to internal pricing guidelines, and minimization of credit losses/net NPA formation across asset categories/departments/functies. Senior managerial personnel may receive higher fixed salaries compared to their peers but shall earn only incremental variable pay as per applicable norms and proportionate bonus pool availability. The board sets overall salary budgets while delegating accountability to senior executives regarding expense outlays under their direct control, which are subject to review/approval process through established channels during annual appraisals. Salary rationalisation reviews every two years utilizing benchmarking data against industry standards/successor banks, considering cost-of-living adjustments annually without any anomalies unless justified changes occur such as job grade enhancements/promotions/pay increments due to exceptional achievement/capability/experience.

An example of this scenario is when the two legs of the transaction consist of completely identical CDS contracts. Under these circumstances, there is no specific risk capital requirement applied to either the hedged position or the CDS.",
            "generated_answer": "When determining specific risk capital requirements for long or short positions involving underlying bonds where these bonds are also used as collateral in an eligible credit-default-swap transaction, no specific risk capital requirement applies. This exclusion extends even if the CDS's reference entity differs from the bond being issued by the bank; it only requires that cash flows under both legs be fully swapped such that either side pays the other fixed or floating interest payments and receives principal at maturity. If more than one set of parallel obligations forms the basis for calculating netting sets within each relevant currency pair, all combinations must form legally enforceable bilateral contracts satisfying this condition. The effects of any non-contractual arrangements like cross-default or cross-acceleration clauses should not be considered when deciding whether a contract provides legal certainty regarding payment streams upon event-of-default. When evaluating compliance with the contractual test, priority leg provisions do not invalidate otherwise valid swap agreements.

            "ground_truth_answer": "In calculating the leverage ratio, the exposure measure typically uses the accounting value. On-balance sheet exposures, excluding derivatives, are considered after deducting specific provisions or accounting valuation adjustments. However, the offsetting of loans and deposits is not permitted. Banks are generally restricted from using collateral, guarantees, or other methods of credit risk mitigation to decrease the exposure measure.",
            "generated_answer": "The exposure measure used to calculate the leverage ratio typically follows an add-on methodology. This means banks should not reduce their reported exposures by deducting investments they have made in eligible securities or other adjustments commonly found in risk-based capital frameworks like deductions for credit valuation adjustment charges (CVA), close-out costs, incurred future credit losses, expected loss amounts under the Standardized Approach for credit impairment stress testing (SAPSIS), residual mortgage servicing obligations from securitization transactions, and specific provisions held against non-performing assets. Additionally, no deduction can be taken for collateral unless it results from applying haircuts as required by Basel III net stable funding framework rules; otherwise, only the clear difference between gross and net positions may be recognized if specified conditions are met. The full amount of deferred tax liabilities resulting from temporary differences arising during the normal course of business must also be included within regulatory adjusted gross exposure measures without any reduction due to potential offsets elsewhere. Banks cannot use total equity attributable to shareholders outside consolidated published figures when calculating Tier 1 Capital Fund, although this could include items such as reserves from core businesses where earnings support growth rather than being retained solely for expansion through new borrowings. Regulatory authorities retain discretion to adjust individual bank's liability measurement depending upon available data and quality for entities showing significant discrepancies relative to common practices across peers over extended periods.

            "ground_truth_answer": "For an irrevocable commitment to provide an off-balance sheet facility, the original maturity is measured from the commitment's start date to the expiration date of the facility it pertains to. The lower of the applicable credit conversion factors (CCF) should be used. As an example, if there is a 15-month irrevocable commitment (which typically has a 50% CCF) to issue a 6-month documentary letter of credit (which typically has a 20% CCF), the 20% CCF associated with the documentary letter of credit should be applied.",
            "generated_answer": "When determining the effective date and maturity of commitments like guarantees or letters of comfort regarding providing off-balance sheet facilities, banks should calculate the 'original maturity' as the shorter of either the period until payment according to contractual terms or 5 years. The applicable credit conversion factors depend on how long before one year from disbursement these exposures remain outstanding; they increase linearly over that preceding one-year period.\n\nFor example:\n- If payments become due within three months after disbursement ('shorter than one month'), CCFA = 20%.\n- Payments becoming due between four months and six months after disbursement ('between one month and half a year'), CCFA = 50%.\n\nThe resulting exposure amount will be used alongside the risk weight assigned by AD Categories when calculating capital requirements under Pillar 1 of Basel III.",

Banks should use pre-printed, serially numbered security forms for issuing guarantees. For guarantees exceeding a specified threshold determined by the bank, dual signatures are necessary, and the guarantee should be executed in triplicate, with copies retained by the issuing branch, the beneficiary, and the controlling office. The bank should advise the beneficiary of the guarantee to seek confirmation of its validity directly from the bank's Controlling Office or Head Office.",

The capital charge is then reduced by the extent to which the option is in the money; the intrinsic value of an in-the-money option lowers the capital charge.",
            "generated_answer": "When computing risk-weighted assets using the simplified method, banks must calculate an extra weighted amount for each individual bought or sold foreign currency interest rate derivative. This involves multiplying either side A or B of the notional principal agreement by specific factors: 190% if it represents payments linked only to USD LIBOR reference rates; 165%, 135%, or 125% respectively, depending on market maturity concerns; plus an additional percentage reflecting potential upward movement from its original value. The resulting figure equals twice the net worth-based exposure measure calculated as described under general rules for calculating exposures for credit conversion factor purposes. However, when determining whether a position qualifies as covered, any premium paid should be deducted from both sides of the transaction before applying these calculations. An exception exists where the capitalized amount exceeds two times the total eligible protection purchase limit (TEP), in which case no further deduction applies. Additionally, the final capital charge excludes amounts representing cash flow swaps referenced against other instruments like debt securities due to their lack of operational flexibility during stress periods. Covered calls can receive full offsetting coverage without reducing gross domestic claims, while all others qualify for partial offset unless they represent long-term bond positions referencing overnight USD-LIBOR/other currencies. If fully hedged at acquisition, such contracts do not incur open-position limits. The effective maturity of the underlying contract determines the time period over which losses would materialize upon unilateral exercise/cancellation of the hedge instrument.",

The amount invoked from the DLG cannot be used to reduce the outstanding balance of the individual loans; thus, the borrower's liability is not affected. As per the agreement between the regulated entity and the DLG provider, any recovery from loans for which the DLG was utilized can be shared with the DLG provider.

This includes both on-balance sheet derivatives collateral and collateral associated with securities financing transactions (SFTs), unless these particular assets are addressed under specific regulatory sections pertaining to derivatives and SFT assets. Nevertheless, assets that have already been subtracted from Tier 1 capital, such as investments in non-consolidated banking, financial, or insurance entities, alongside any deficits in eligible provisions compared to expected losses as calculated under the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach, can also be deducted from the exposure measure.",
            "generated_answer": "When computing a bank's exposure measure for leverage ratio purposes, all balance sheet assets must be included except cash deposits from individuals or corporates meeting specific criteria. However, direct exposures that meet these eligibility requirements can also serve as offsetting collateral against other eligible items like loans secured by equities issued by banks within the same group. Banks need not deduct any goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax liabilities recognized in the balance sheets, or contra-assets such as revaluation reserves if they do not form part of Tier 1 capital under regulatory accounting frameworks. The full amount of open positions in foreign exchange contracts entered into for trading purposes should generally remain outside this list unless covered separately via an appropriate hedge. Banks may consider establishing internal policies covering hedging techniques used during periods where market information isn't available before applying them broadly across their business lines without verification.

As part of this process, banks are required to disclose a full reconciliation of all regulatory capital elements to the balance sheet within their financial statements. This reconciliation aims to address any discrepancies between the figures used for regulatory capital calculation and the figures presented in the balance sheet.

            "generated_answer": "Banks must closely link all regulatory capital calculations back to the data reported on the Balance Sheet. To achieve this, banks should adjust both sides of the equation by adding or subtracting components that represent changes in defined accounting standards/restrictions during the year under review relative to prior years.

            "ground_truth_answer": "In the bond forward market, a market-maker is an entity that quotes buying and selling prices to both customers and other market-makers, thereby fostering trading activity. Entities eligible to serve as market-makers consist of Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding Small Finance Banks, Payment Banks, Local Area Banks, and Regional Rural Banks) and Standalone Primary Dealers (SPDs). These market-makers are allowed to hold unlimited long positions and covered short positions. Furthermore, entities authorized to engage in short selling are permitted to establish uncovered short positions, provided that the underlying government security meets the requirements for short selling and the positions adhere to the specified security-level limits and maximum duration for covered short positions.",

To get this approval, the bank needs to demonstrate that it will either replace the PDIs with capital of the same or higher quality, in a way that is sustainable given the bank's income capacity, or prove that its capital position will remain significantly above the minimum regulatory requirements even after the repurchase or redemption.",

Lenders must provide borrowers with the option to switch to a fixed interest rate. Borrowers should also be given choices to either increase their EMI amount, extend the loan's duration, or make prepayments on the loan.

In this formula, RC represents the replacement cost, the add-on signifies the potential future exposure, CA denotes the volatility-adjusted collateral amount, and r indicates the risk weight assigned to the counterparty. If effective bilateral netting contracts are utilized, the RC will be the net replacement cost, and the add-on will be ANet.",
            "generated_answer": "When calculating the counterparty credit risk capital charge for an OTC derivative contract not hedged by effectively matched exchange-traded derivatives or securities financing transactions, banks must use the Current Exposure Method. This involves summing separate charges calculated as if each individual underlying obligation were directly exposed to loss through default: collateral received reduces exposure; current outstanding principal increases it; future potential future exposures arising from mark-to-market valuation fluctuations also add to it but can be reduced proportionately where there is an agreed formula for marking such positions to market linked to changes in interest rates only. If bilateral netting agreements provide legal certainty that all included exposures will extinguish upon payment under any simultaneous event of cross-default then these arrangements may reduce or eliminate the overall CEM-based exposure amount. Where two parties have legally enforceable agreements providing for mutual offsetting obligations due upon the occurrence of one party's bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or similar events they shall receive no regulatory discount for applying the CEM methodology in respect of their combined gross positive fair value exposure.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "In situations where a regulated entity is party to a Default Loss Guarantee (DLG) arrangement, the classification of a loan as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA), along with the corresponding provisioning requirements, continues to be the responsibility of the regulated entity. This determination adheres to established asset classification and provisioning norms, irrespective of any DLG coverage in place. It is important to note that the amount recovered through the invocation of the DLG cannot be utilized to decrease the borrower's outstanding loan obligation.",
            "generated_answer": "When a bank employs an approved guarantor for its loans and has entered into a contract that includes a Default Loss Guarantee (DLG), any losses arising from default by either party before the DLG period expire will be shared proportionately between the lender and the guarantor. During this DLG cover period, no NPA classification or provisioning requirements apply to accounts where payments have been deferred due to pandemic-related constraints; these deferrals must still align with existing moratorium policies. If the guaranteed debtor defaults during this covered period but continues to receive credit facilities from other sources within the guarantee framework without breaching terms agreed upon with the lending institution, their account remains outside regulatory-defined NPAs until principal dues exceed outstanding guarantees. However, if payment arrears persist beyond specified periods post-default at the hands of third-party lenders while under continuous DLG coverage, standard assets revert back to being classified as doubtful/losses according to extant norms after 90 days overdue when financed directly by such third parties. The original sanctioned limit ceases operation once the full amount owing via DLG arrangements becomes payable by way of prepayment/re-financing/support from other sources or write-off/doubtful status following non-payment/removal of encumbrances beyond prescribed timelines, unless subsequent re-lending from the regulator-sanctioned fund restores the total disbursed amount. When partial or complete repayment exceeds actual disbursal amounts through funds sourced from regulators' funded schemes, only proportional provisions should be made against the residual outstanding balance up to the maximum drawdown authorized initially. Any deficiency in provision required above the proportional share relative to the entire unsecured advance may be charged off from CET1 capital instead. Payments received exceeding due installments can reverse the debit balance created earlier in profit & loss account or towards building CECL reserve based on board-approved policy, followed by proportional recognition of income on drawing power basis within legal limits.",

To mitigate the impact on quarterly financial results, the bank has the option to distribute these provisions over a maximum of four quarters, beginning from the quarter in which the fraud was identified. Should the complete provisioning extend beyond a single financial year, at the close of that year, the bank should reduce 'other reserves' by the amount that remains un-provisioned, while increasing provisions accordingly. Subsequently, these reductions should be reversed proportionally in the following quarters of the next financial year, with corresponding debits to the profit and loss statement. Furthermore, banks are required to disclose the total number of fraud cases reported, the aggregate sums involved, the provisions allocated during the year, and the unamortised portion of the provision that was deducted from 'other reserves' at the end of the financial year.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "For Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), Housing Finance Companies (HFCs), Asset Reconstruction Companies, and Standalone Primary Dealers, the 'Owned Fund' is determined by adding together paid-up equity capital, preference shares that must be converted into equity, unencumbered reserves, the balance in the share premium account, and capital reserves that represent surplus from the sale of assets (excluding revaluation reserves). From this total, subtract any accumulated losses, the book value of intangible assets, and deferred revenue expenditure. Furthermore, contingency reserves are incorporated in accordance with specific guidelines for Mortgage Guarantee Companies.",
            "generated_answer": "The definition of owned fund includes paid-up equity capital; contributions from associate or nominal shareholders subject to prescribed conditions; non-refundable consideration received as part of delayed repayment facilities where such payments have not been recognized as revenue; outstanding amounts due under long-term borrowings classified as Held For Trading which qualify for revaluation gains; reserves including both free reserves and provisions held against depreciation in the value of investments; and any other asset that can be reckoned as owned fund by convention. The net book value of goodwill according to Schedule B should also be included if positive. However, intangible assets must exclude deferred tax liabilities arising from temporary differences unless these represent ownership interests meeting specific criteria.

According to this policy, banks must conduct a quarterly review assessing the performance of different economic sectors to which they have provided loans. This review involves analyzing both quantitative factors (such as debt-equity ratio, interest coverage ratio, and profit margins) and qualitative factors (like ratings upgrade to downgrade ratio, sectoral non-performing assets/stressed assets, industry performance and outlook, and any relevant legal or regulatory issues) to evaluate existing and potential risks.",

This committee, which includes professionals from technical, financial, and legal fields, evaluates the borrower's financial status, the anticipated recovery period, expected revenues, and cash flow.

            "ground_truth_answer": "For a bank employing a Credit Default Swap (CDS) to mitigate credit risk in its corporate bond holdings, credit protection recognition is contingent on the CDS contract's remaining maturity. Specifically, no credit protection is acknowledged if the CDS's residual maturity is under three months. Conversely, if the residual maturity equals or exceeds three months, protection is recognized proportionally to its availability, ceasing once the residual maturity falls below three months.",
            "generated_answer": "When determining if a bank's exposure has been reduced due to hedging instruments like Credit Default Swaps (CDS), banks must consider that CDS positions without an explicit claim to receive payments from the underlying issuer only reduce credit risk up to the point when payment would be made. Therefore, these swaps cannot provide protection indefinitely for longer than the residual maturity of the reference or deliverable obligation. For instance, a two-year CDS covering a five-year bond would not have provided any reduction by year three unless an additional one- or two-year CDS was purchased at some point during years three through four.",

For example, where a bank has issued corporate bonds collateralized by another bond issued by the same entity named in a contract, this reference would be considered explicit naming. Additionally, referencing any securities issuance facilities used as collateral in secured borrowings also qualifies as explicit naming. However, general references like 'our own debt' do not constitute explicit naming. The borrower/bond issue must represent a direct claim on cash flows from the underlying obligation covered under the protection arrangement; indirect exposure mechanisms such as repackaging products should generally attract full-specific-risk charging.

            "ground_truth_answer": "When determining overall capital adequacy as part of the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), banks are expected to evaluate risk diversification by considering correlations both within and between various risk categories, specifically under stressed conditions. Banks must provide justification for any diversification benefits recognized between legal entities, particularly focusing on the unrestricted flow of capital during periods of financial stress. The effect of diversification should be assessed through a comparison of scenarios that assume full correlation (representing no diversification) against scenarios that assume no correlation (representing full diversification).",
            "generated_answer": "When considering diversified portfolios within an ICAAP assessment framework, banks should analyze how various sources of risk interact. While diversification generally reduces exposure across multiple dimensions like regions or industries, focusing solely on correlation without acknowledging potential negative correlations between different types of losses can be misleading, especially during periods of market stress. Banks must assess these complex interactions comprehensively while also evaluating their ability to identify significant concentrations among diverse exposures that could create concentrated risks beyond standard analyses. The interaction of liquidity concerns affecting both asset quality and profitability necessitates careful consideration by senior management regarding contingency funding plans addressing illiquidity scenarios potentially harming business continuity due to impaired access to funds from cash assets or liabilities maturing unevenly under adverse conditions. Additionally, firms need strong governance structures capable of managing reputational threats arising from decisions impacting short-term profits yet essential for maintaining long-term viability against economic downturns characterized by reduced discretionary lending capacity as credit availability contracts amid deteriorating asset prices.",

This excludes housing loans, education loans, vehicle loans, and loans secured by gold and gold jewellery. Microfinance loans, considered as consumer credit but not qualifying as regulatory retail, have a risk weight of 100%.

All remaining consumer credit exposures are assigned a risk weight of 100%, unless stated differently.",
            "generated_answer": "For individual or small business term loan accounts classified as consumer credit, an initial risk weight of 125% applies. Consumer revolving credits like overdraft facilities, cash credit limits, and personal loans have a starting point of 100%. Credit card receivables initially carry a risk weight of 150%, although this can be increased to 200% if there's evidence of deteriorating performance over time after the first year.

            "ground_truth_answer": "In situations where companies are facing financial difficulties, obtaining personal guarantees from the company's promoters or directors can be advantageous. This is because such guarantees can incentivize more responsible and effective management, as well as increased accountability, which can contribute to improvements in the company's financial health and operational performance.",
            "generated_answer": "When lending money to entities facing financial difficulties, offering personal guarantees can be useful. These guarantees provide an additional layer of security for lenders by tying the guarantor directly to the loan agreement. This mechanism aims to deter potential defaulters and may encourage more responsible management practices within the borrowing entity. If there were any doubts about whether certain individuals should have been included as guarantors initially but they subsequently became involved due to promotions or changes at higher levels of corporate governance, it would still make sense to include them now that their involvement has occurred. Lenders often want borrowers who will take some kind of action if things go wrong; requiring such parties to stand behind the borrower adds another lever against future defaults. Personal guarantees also serve as documentation confirming that each individual accepts full legal responsibility for fulfilling all obligations under the contract. Even with government schemes like Priority Sector Lending targets set aside for small enterprises, banks shouldn't hesitate to require personal guarantees because these provisions remain valid even where funds meet specific priority sector eligibility criteria. In cases involving overseas lenders extending finance through IFSC Banking Units, state governments acting as host supervisors must ensure compliance with statutory norms regarding guaranteeing arrangements before approving credit facilities extended to domestic concern members operating out of IFSC areas. Banks need not obtain separate guarantees solely for complying with statutory mandates issued by governmental departments or other regulatory bodies governing commercial activities unrelated to capital adequacy requirements. Additionally, guarantees provided by professionals associated exclusively with non-banking financial institutions do not necessitate further personal guarantees from key managerial personnel employed therein.",

This classification mandates a provisioning of 5% starting from the date of restructuring. This provision must be maintained until the project achieves commencement of commercial operations, or for a period of two years from the restructuring date, whichever occurs later. The loan's classification can be upgraded to 'standard' once the entire project begins its commercial operations.",
            "generated_answer": "When an extension beyond 12 months occurs before commencement of commercial operations (COC), but DCCOs up to 3 years from original date remain eligible within their original period without requiring additional approval. If COCs occur after more than 1 year but less than or equal to 3 years from the original date, they require prior regulatory approval; however, no new exposures should be sanctioned until full repayment/repatriation of existing ones at current rates. The loan's asset classification and provision requirements depend on whether financing banks have access to funding at the then-prevailing interest rate during CIC assessment periods: if not, 'sub-standard' assets must maintain that status until cash flows start supporting repaying obligations, otherwise classified as standard; provisioning required ranges between specific sectors/circular reference-based norms and minimum statutory provisions plus risk-weighted incremental additions calculated over revised LGPA.

Specifically, concerning performance guarantees, banks should undertake a thorough verification of the customer's track record, competence, and resources to meet the obligations outlined in the contract, thereby reducing the potential for default.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks must have clear guidelines for issuing guarantees, ensuring commitments do not become too high relative to capital. They also need robust procedures for monitoring guarantor or collateral availability when defaults occur, considering actions like reducing exposure limits, imposing penalties such as increased interest rates during default periods, requiring performance bonds until delinquencies are resolved, or taking legal action against parties who fail to honor their obligations under bank-guaranteed instruments.

Specifically, for undrawn or partially undrawn fund-based facilities, the calculation of off-balance sheet exposures includes the maximum unused portion accessible until maturity. The drawn portion is treated as part of the bank's on-balance sheet credit exposure.",
            "generated_answer": "When calculating total credit exposure from non-market-related off-balance-sheet items exceeding one year, banks should multiply the contracted amount by a factor reflecting potential future drawdown. Specifically, an 80% risk weight multiplier applies if more than half but up to two-thirds of the transaction's value has been drawn as of April 1, 2024; otherwise, a 90% risk weight multiplier is used. For shorter periods like five years or less, banks must use their best estimates of when each facility would be likely to be drawn during any ensuing twelve-month period starting April 1, 2025, applying appropriate percentages based on drawings being made at various time intervals within that twelve-month period. Undrawn portions of fund-based channels not earmarked specifically for working capital may also need separate accounting treatment due to their role in supporting general borrowings where actual drawing powers vary over time without clear contractual limits.

            "ground_truth_answer": "Following a temporary write-down of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) instruments, if the issuing bank merges with another bank, the resulting entity has the option to reverse the write-down of these instruments.",
            "generated_answer": "If an additional tier 1 instrument undergoes a temporary write-down due to falling below one or more pre-specified trigger levels during normal operation, it may be extinguished upon merger into another eligible entity. However, if this condition applies at any time before the issue matures, all outstanding principal must be converted into ordinary shares of the resulting merged bank according to established rules governing conversion preferences for new common equity capital instruments issued by banks after initial issuance. The amount of such instruments absorbed should not exceed regulatory limits specified under Basel III Capital Regulations pertaining to maximum holdings of consolidated subsidiaries in the case of private sector non-financial entities as well as minimum ownership requirements within the holding company/parent group. No dividends can be paid out of revaluation reserves created from the write-up component; instead, only fully entitled free reserves can be utilized for declaring dividend payments on these instruments. If these provisions fail to preserve full loss absorption capacity, losses will be recognized proportionately through charge against CET-1 equal to the extent of shortfall relative to total potential losses sustained until actual repayment equals par value plus premium amortized over remaining maturity at perpetual debt rate.",

Specifically, these deductions include: management fees recognized during the planning period but not realized within 180 days after the planning period ends; management fees recognized post-planning period that remain unrealized for more than 180 days from recognition; and any unrealized management fees associated with Security Receipts whose net asset value has decreased to below 50% of their face value.

Because banks calculate drawing power using current assets, stock statements must be updated regularly\u2014specifically, no older than three months\u2014to accurately reflect the value of these assets.",

If these exceed permissible norms by more than 10% for short-term borrowing accounts, they will be classified as NPA if not repaid within specified timeframes. For term loans, this limit applies from two crop seasons or six months after acquisition, whichever occurs first.

Here, Gamma is the gamma of the option position. VU, representing the variation of the underlying asset, is determined by asset class. For interest rate options, VU reflects the price sensitivity of the underlying bond or interest rate. In the case of foreign exchange and gold options, VU is the market value of the underlying asset multiplied by 9 percent.",
            "generated_answer": "Under the delta-plus approach, if S represents the current value of the underlying asset, VU denotes its volatility over one business day at expiration, Te indicates time-to-expiration from today's date until maturity minus any adjustments due to holidays or early terminations, then gamma times sigma squared divided by two equals 0.25 percent. The resulting change in variance ((sigma squared)/two) can be expressed as either: VU = square root of [(S multiplied by zero point zero five eight nine six subtracted by T squared multiplye by zero point four seven three)] where T equates to days remaining till maturity divided by thirty-six hundred fifty; or VU = square root of [square of S multiplied by zero point zerosixteen ninety five substracted by T squared multiplyed by square of zero point twenty one fortythree] again with T being same calculation as above.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "In financing projects abroad and issuing guarantees for them, banks must comprehensively evaluate the project's financial and technical needs relative to the abilities of contractors and international employers. This evaluation should exceed the rigor applied to domestic projects, due to the substantial values at stake and the risk of foreign exchange losses, along with potential harm to the reputation of Indian businesses if the project fails. Banks should also deliberate carefully on issuing guarantees for overseas borrowings, even when the Export-Import Bank of India (Exim Bank) participates and the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India (ECGC) provides counter-guarantees. Establishing strong post-award follow-up and monitoring processes is also crucial.",
            "generated_answer": "When extending credit facilities abroad or providing guarantees for overseas transactions involving Indian goods or services, banks must assess risks such as political instability, exchange rate fluctuations against currencies within their home jurisdiction, potential loss due to conflict between laws governing contracts entered into by foreigners operating there versus the host country's legal system. Additionally, they need to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements under FEMA regarding remittances beyond the sanctioned limit without prior approval from SEBI/ICEGATE.",

These criteria include the recipient counterparty's cash not being segregated for trades not cleared via a qualifying central counterparty, daily calculation and exchange of variation margin based on mark-to-market valuation, receipt of cash variation margin in the same currency used for settling the derivative contract, exchange of variation margin covering the total amount needed to eliminate mark-to-market exposure, and coverage of both derivative transactions and variation margins under a single, legally binding master netting agreement.",
            "generated_answer": "When calculating leverage ratios, if variations between mark-to-market values due solely from changes in reference rates or other non-currency factors occur before an agreed settlement date under bilateral OTC derivative contracts, these differences can be considered a pre-settlement payment. This means that only the contract notional amount adjusted by any legally enforceable haircut reflecting such changes should be included within Tier 1 capital at each day-end. The realized gain/loss upon settlement will then be reflected in regulatory capital after adjustments have been made for haircuts representing time-related price movement risk.",

            "generated_answer": "Priority Sector Lending certificates under farmers' schemes can be used by banks towards fulfilling their obligations for small and marginal farmer lending. This includes direct agricultural credit as well as credit extended for allied activities such as post-harvest processing, storage facilities, marketing loans promoting income generation through agriculture or animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries and bee keeping etc., but excludes land purchases from public auction. The S&M Farmer target comprises both core rural and non-core urban sectors within the overall farm loan category. However, if an eligible entity provides fresh finance only to augment stock holdings without linking it directly to improving productivity or enhancing output efficiency, that portion of credit does not qualify for inclusion in either the priority sector or S&M Farmer sub-targets; instead, these funds should be classified outside the specified categories.",

Banks must maintain an additional buffer beyond these minimum regulatory standards as part of their firm-level risk management strategy.
