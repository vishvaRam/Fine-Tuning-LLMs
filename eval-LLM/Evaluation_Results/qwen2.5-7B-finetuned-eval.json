Additionally, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may take further actions, such as disallowing the bank from obtaining preferential capital treatment for its securitized assets. The RBI might also mandate the bank to allocate capital against all securitized assets as if the bank had explicitly committed to them. Furthermore, the bank could be required to treat all securitized assets as if they were still part of its balance sheet when calculating capital, and the RBI could demand that the bank maintain regulatory capital beyond the minimum risk-based capital ratios.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "Banks should not classify a working capital account as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA) solely because of temporary deficiencies. Banks should ensure that drawings in the working capital account are covered by the adequacy of current assets, even when there are temporary issues such as non-availability of adequate drawing power or non-renewal of limits.",

However, banks may maintain an additional watch list category above standard for such shortfalls when classifying loans as NPAs; this category is known as 'Weak Signals'. If a borrower's account shows weak signals due to temporary cash flow difficulties but has adequate repayment capacity within six months from its original loan date, it can be classified as 'standard' while being monitored closely until resolution. This monitoring continues even after the account upgrades to sub-standard status upon default. Accounts meeting these criteria must also be reported by banks using CIMS.",

Additionally, they could offer performance guarantee facilities without requiring margin deposits or bank guarantees if the bidder's credit history indicates stability within the last three years. Banks must ensure that exporters have sufficient working capital funds available from their own resources before extending such guarantees to prevent them from relying solely on bank guarantees. If necessary, banks might require an undertaking from the exporter regarding how payments will be made after receiving approval. To mitigate risks associated with delays due to factors beyond their control like political instability abroad or natural disasters, banks may obtain government backing at nominal charges through insurance companies approved under FEMA rules, ensuring compliance with existing guidelines concerning overseas contracts.

            "generated_answer": "When dealing with agreements concerning government security transactions or other commitments requiring collateralization by Government Securities, it is essential for banks to assess whether their counterparties can fulfill these obligations. This evaluation helps ensure that any potential losses from default remain within acceptable limits at both the individual bank level and across the banking sector as a whole. It also ensures that there will be sufficient liquidity available if needed due to market disruptions affecting secondary markets. Furthermore, evaluating a counterparty's ability to meet its obligations protects against reputational damage resulting from non-performance events.",

This exclusion persists until the bank's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio reaches 8% without relying on the replenished equity.

If the total provisioning falls short of 0.4%, it will have to be built up within one year starting from March 31st of that year; however, this provision should not exceed the maximum permissible level prescribed under regulatory guidelines for banks' provisions against NPAs/SLAR/SOSA/SLRC accounts.

            "question": "What steps are involved in managing fund transfers when a bank's stake in a borrower is below 10% of the banking system's total stake, and what other options are available if no bank meets the minimum stake requirement?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "In situations where a bank's financial exposure to a borrower accounts for less than 10% of the entire banking system's exposure to that same borrower, any debits from the borrower's Cash Credit/Overdraft (CC/OD) account must be directly credited to the borrower's CC/OD account held with a bank that possesses 10% or more of the total exposure. Subsequently, the funds are transferred to the latter account at predetermined intervals. Should no single lender meet the minimum 10% exposure criterion, the funds may be transferred to the borrower's account held with the bank having the largest share of the exposure. Alternatively, the borrower has the option to obtain working capital demand loans or term loans and establish current accounts in accordance with the aggregate exposure.",
            "generated_answer": "When a bank's stake in a borrower remains less than ten percent of its net owned funds or capital base at any point during the year for which financial information was submitted by all banks concerned, it may transfer its share from one special purpose vehicle (SPV) to another. Banks can also seek an approval from the Board to move their shares out of SPVs altogether after considering factors like board composition, transparency levels, debt-equity ratio, leverage levels, earnings capacity, credit rating, dividend policy, liquidity profile, and funding sources of the borrower company, as well as compliance with existing regulatory guidelines concerning loans and advances against securities held in demised companies. If none of these conditions apply and there isn't sufficient data availability across all banks to meet the minimum threshold for a single SPV, banks should consider moving their investments into multiple SPVs until this condition is satisfied.",

For instance, they could limit their exposure to longer maturities by implementing a policy where no new business can be undertaken beyond certain maturity thresholds such as 7 years, 10 years, etc., unless specific conditions are met. Banks should also consider establishing minimum residual maturity requirements at least once per quarter within prescribed time frames depending upon market movements. This includes ensuring investments do not remain idle for too long due to mismatches between cash flows from loans receivable and advances. Furthermore, banks should ensure that all future commitments like letters of credit have shorter residual maturities than existing assets if possible; otherwise, additional funds must be raised through sources having shorter maturity periods.

To protect their interests, the bank should secure a guarantee from the appraiser, which may include a cash deposit and an indemnity bond. It is preferable that the assessment and valuation be conducted on the bank's premises. However, if the valuation must occur off-site, the bank is responsible for implementing safety measures against potential loss while the items are in transit. These precautions should include transporting the ornaments in a secured, locked container, with both the appraiser and the bank holding keys, and the consignment accompanied by a bank employee and the borrower. Furthermore, the bank should arrange for insurance coverage to protect against any potential loss of the gold ornaments during transit.",

This agreement must give the custodian bank an absolute right to the securities that will be received as payment in any settlement. However, this requirement is waived if the transactions are pre-funded.

            "ground_truth_answer": "If a compounding amount requested by an applicant is connected to a prior compounding order, the new request is considered a separate, new application. The compounding amount in the new application will be treated independently and not combined with the amount in the previous order.",
            "generated_answer": "When an individual has already received one compoundable monetary penalty from the RBI under Section 12A or 47(5)(a) for another contravention within three years before applying for compensation, any additional payment made towards that earlier compounding cannot be considered. Therefore, only half of the previously paid compounding amount can be included as per Rule 6(3) read with sub-Rule (9). This means if someone was penalized \u20b920 lakh initially but settled it by paying \u20b918 lakh, they would receive compensation up to \u20b99 lakh for this contravention since only Rs.9 lakh out of \u20b918 lakhs could have been accounted for while considering rule provisions.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "In situations where banks offer loan conversion options, they are instructed not to reject a borrower's application simply because the borrower is unable to provide land as security, offering instead personal security or hypothecation of crops. Furthermore, if the borrower already possesses a term loan secured by land, the bank is expected to accept a second charge on the same land for the converted loan and should waive the requirement for third-party guarantees.",
            "generated_answer": "When providing loan conversion facilities like interest subvention or priority sector lending credit enhancement by government agencies, banks should adhere to established prudential norms. If these loans have security such as hypothecation rights over machinery/equipment/stock-in-trade or other suitable pledges-mortgages/guarantees from third parties or guarantors, banks must ensure that existing regulatory requirements regarding eligibility and adequacy of collateral continue to be met after converting part of the term loan into equity. Banks can create fresh charges if necessary due to the change in asset category post-conversion; however, this requires prior approval from their Board. Additionally, while specific provisions may not apply at time of disbursement if full information isn't available immediately upon application receipt, banks still need to comply with all applicable rules.

Banks also need to ensure that they will not have to provide loans or advances to cover liabilities arising from the invocation of such guarantees.",
            "generated_answer": "When extending credit facilities or other benefits to directors, banks must ensure that any guarantee provided by them does not contravene the provisions under section 20(1)(b) of the Banking Regulation Act. To achieve this, banks should have board-approved policies outlining specific limits applicable to each director's guaranteed liability; these limits may be linked individually to either the total assets or capital funds, including reserves held at the bank level. Banks should also obtain declarations from directors confirming they understand these limits before issuing guarantees exceeding those specified amounts. Additionally, banks can require collateral security covering the entire amount due from both the borrower and guarantor as part of the arrangement.

To manage this risk, banks should thoroughly examine their funding sources and how they use these funds, gain a deep understanding of funding market dynamics, and evaluate the efficacy of their plans for contingent funding needs. It is also important for senior management to be aware of the interdependence between liquidity and capital levels, recognizing that liquidity issues can negatively affect capital adequacy and the reverse is also true. To effectively handle periods of financial instability, banks should hold substantial reserves of easily accessible, high-quality liquid assets that are free from any encumbrances.",

            "generated_answer": "When discounting bills guaranteed by other banks or rediscounted at banks for amounts exceeding Rs. 20 lakhs per borrower, banks must ensure they adhere strictly to guidelines regarding guarantees provided by other banks, as outlined in relevant instructions.

The specific adjustment factor depends on how many years' worth of arrears there are; one year's arrears results in no reduction but increases other deductions from Tier I Capital, two years reduce the face value at various percentages depending on whether it was due before October 9, 2025, between that date and December 8, 2026, etc., up until November 7, 2028, three years also decrease the face value similarly, while four consecutive years result in the full amount being deducted from Tier-I Capital, leading to zero eligible capital funds.",

An account's asset classification can stay the same or improve after a set time if the borrower meets the requirements for special regulatory consideration and performs as expected. The asset will be downgraded to substandard or doubtful categories depending on how long it has been past due if the borrower doesn't meet the requirements or doesn't perform well.",

This valuation should be conducted by the bank itself, approved valuers, or inspecting officers from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). To classify the exposure as unsecured, the realisable value of the security should not exceed 10 percent of the initial outstanding exposure.",
            "generated_answer": "When determining an unsecured exposure's classification, banks may use either book values or market prices. If neither method accurately reflects the underlying asset's true price due to extraordinary circumstances affecting its liquidity, fair valuation techniques should be employed by qualified professionals like valuers appointed by entities like the National Stock Exchange of India Limited or Clearing Corporation of India Ltd., who must follow applicable standards from bodies such as FICCI, ASSOCHAM, ICRA, CRISIL, IBAI, etc. The sum total of these exposures cannot exceed 10 percent of the bank\u2019s Tier-I capital at the end of the preceding quarter.",

This classification necessitates a provisioning of 5% from the date of restructuring.

Deciding whether to restructure an advance requires a comprehensive evaluation of the entity's potential for success, quick identification of any shortcomings, and the swift implementation of restructuring strategies. Restructuring is appropriate only when the borrower's financial soundness is confirmed and there is strong confidence in repayment under the new terms. Important metrics to consider include Return on Capital Employed, Debt Service Coverage Ratio, and the margin between the Internal Rate of Return and the Cost of Funds. If an account is not likely to succeed financially, restructuring should not be pursued, and instead, recovery actions should take precedence.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "Small Finance Banks are permitted to classify new loans given to registered Non-Banking Financial Company-Micro Finance Institutions (NBFC-MFIs) and other Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) as priority sector lending. This classification is allowed if the MFIs are members of a Self-Regulatory Organization recognized by the RBI, have a gross loan portfolio not exceeding \u20b9500 crore as of March 31, 2021, and the funds are further lent to individual borrowers. The total bank credit allowed for this purpose is capped at 10% of the Small Finance Bank's total priority sector portfolio as of March 31, 2021.",
            "generated_answer": "For lenders other than Commercial Banks to be considered eligible for classification under the priority sector category when providing credit facilities to registered NBFC-MFIs or UCBs categorized as MFIs, they need to obtain 51% shareholding by value from these entities. The term 'registered' refers only to registration under Section 4(2)(a) or clause (vii) read with sub-clause (iii) of Explanation I of section 3(b) of the National Banking Development Act, 2016. Additionally, at least one-third of the total outstanding amount of all loans granted during any given quarter should come from these registered NBFC-MFI/UCBs. Lastly, no more than ten percent of the bank's gross priority sector lending can consist of advances made to this segment; however, small finance banks that do not provide direct financing but rely solely on indirect routes like factoring companies may exceed this limit if they have fully implemented Core Banking Solutions (CBS).",

This is because these tools are necessary for effectively auditing the complex computer environments where these entities store their accounting and business data.",
            "generated_answer": "Auditors handling audits at large entities should possess enhanced technical capabilities due to their substantial size. To effectively manage these engagements, it's preferable that they have acquired specialized knowledge through formal training or practical work experiences involving advanced technology such as Business Intelligence & Analytics tools like SAP BI, Tableau, PowerBi, QlikView, etc., Big Data technologies including Hadoop MapReduce, Hive, Pig, Spark MLlib, etc.; Cloud Computing Platforms like Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform; Machine Learning techniques using Python/R programming languages, Deep learning models, etc. These skills enable them to leverage digital solutions when required during audit planning, execution, review phases, data collection/processing, analysis/reporting stages while also maintaining rigorous professional standards and ethical norms. The need arises from the increasing reliance by banks on big data analytics and sophisticated information systems, necessitating skilled professionals who can assess both human risk perception and machine-driven risks, especially concerning potential biases or algorithmic vulnerabilities.",

This encompasses currency risks linked to transactions between residents that are denominated in or linked to a foreign currency but settled in Indian Rupees.

The currency involved may differ between these two sets of cash flows but can also match if there will be both inflows and outflows occurring at different times during the same period.

Additionally, the underlying obligation and the reference/deliverable obligation must have the same debtor and include legally binding cross-default or cross-acceleration clauses.",
            "generated_answer": "An asset mismatch may occur when the underlying obligations that can be legally or contractually delivered as payment for credit default protection under a CDS differ substantially from the obligations which the reference entity would have issued. However, this asset mismatch should not arise because the deliverable assets are less liquid than the cash settlement payable upon maturity due solely to market liquidity conditions; rather it arises only where there exists no reasonable expectation that the two sets of obligations will settle at approximately equal values. In such cases, banks must value the derivative according to its fair value using model-based valuation techniques and include a 10% haircut on both legs of the transaction, even though it appears fully collateralized by legal provisions.

Investments categorized as HTM should typically not be more than 25% of a bank's overall investment portfolio. Banks are permitted to exceed the 25% limit if the additional investments are exclusively Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) securities, provided that the total SLR securities within the HTM category do not exceed 25% of the bank's Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) as of the last Friday of the second preceding fortnight.",

A portion may be held at an investment level lower than HTM if these instruments meet specific criteria: they must have less than five years remaining maturity when initially acquired or reclassified; the intention upon acquisition was to hold them until maturity; all payments owed from principal or interest will occur before any payment due from capital reserves; and it is assuredly possible that the instrument won't mature prior to redemption due to regulatory actions like conversion into common shares. If the tenor exceeds five years but meets other stipulations, such instruments cannot qualify for inclusion within HTM classification unless specifically permitted otherwise.

The fast pace of innovation in securitisation methods and instruments can magnify these risks. The minimum capital requirements outlined in Pillar 1 might not adequately cover all of these risks. Therefore, a bank's Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) should address these risks thoroughly. This assessment should include evaluations of credit, market, liquidity, and reputational risks, possible defaults and losses on the assets underlying the securitisation, exposures arising from credit lines or liquidity facilities provided to special purpose entities, and exposures resulting from guarantees extended by third parties.",
            "generated_answer": "Securitisations can expose banks to various risk exposures that may not fully align with their Pillar I regulatory capital adequacy. These include credit concentration risk arising from single-name or portfolio-specific exposure concentrations; counterparty credit protection decay due to changes in underlying asset prices during trading periods before settlement occurs at maturity; prepayment and extension risks; liquidity risks resulting from illiquidity created by collateralization structures; funding-related credit valuation adjustments linked to volatility shocks affecting funding costs; performance uncertainty associated with uncertain cash flows when valuing securitized assets; interest rate mismatch between floating-rate liabilities and fixed-rate receivables impacting Net Interest Income; optionality embedded within structured transactions potentially increasing default probability; market price volatilities affecting future payments; and other operational risks inherent across each step of securities issuance processes. While these issues are well-recognized under Basel III standards, they typically don't receive adequate consideration through traditional Pillar-I approaches like Standardised Approach (SA), Advanced Measurement Approaches (AMA), Internal Ratings Based approach (IRB).

The amount of variable pay should correspond to the person's role and associated risks, increasing with greater responsibility. This pay must be genuinely variable, with the possibility of being reduced to zero depending on the performance of the individual, the business unit, or the entire company. The company's board can decide to defer a portion of the variable pay, taking into account the time frame of the risks involved. Compensation for individuals in control and assurance roles should be separate from the business areas they supervise, featuring a larger fixed component but still including variable pay to enable malus or clawback mechanisms.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks should establish clear structures defining what constitutes 'variable' elements within performance-based remuneration. These components can include annual bonuses or other forms of bonus schemes linked to individual performance metrics such as profit targets or risk-adjusted returns. The maximum total variable component payable under any performance-related scheme must not exceed 100% of basic salary; however, this cap may be reduced if deemed necessary by the bank's board. Variable payments cannot be deferred below three years unless explicitly permitted due to exceptional circumstances like severe market downturns affecting corporate value or substantial losses at an entity level.\n\nFor Key Management Personnel who have been employed less than five years and senior management whose tenure exceeds six months but has yet to meet that threshold, banks typically provide full immediate payment of their salaries and benefits upon termination without prior notice during the first two years from date of joining. After year one, the remaining period until the fifth anniversary becomes subject to non-cancellation provisions following normal procedures after two years.

Furthermore, the UCB must possess written legal opinions affirming that courts and administrative authorities would view the UCB's exposure as a net amount, as per the laws of the counterparty's jurisdiction, the laws governing the individual transactions, and the laws governing any contract essential for enacting the netting.

The classification of borrower accounts as Special Mention Accounts (SMA) and Non-Performing Assets (NPA) must also occur as part of the day-end process for the applicable date.

They should also promptly upgrade SMA assets to NPA categories if they remain non-performing after 90 days.

For the remaining defaulted amount, 72.75% is assigned a 0% risk weight, up to a limit determined by the formula CP - C - SLA*0.15. In this formula, CP represents the crystallized portfolio, C is the total claims received in prior years, and SLA denotes the sanctioned limit for each account within the crystallized portfolio. The remaining portion of the defaulted amount is subject to a risk weight based on the counterparty or the Regulatory Retail Portfolio (RRP), as applicable. The maximum capital charge is capped at a notional level calculated by considering the entire exposure as unguaranteed.",

For default cases where banks have invoked guarantees but still face losses due to delays or non-recovery, these additional losses can be deducted up front if explicitly stated at the time of invoking the guarantee; otherwise, they will follow normal provisions. These deductions do not affect asset classification status nor trigger provisioning requirements. The net loss amount after considering such write-offs must then receive specific risk weightings similar to other exposures without any further capital deductions for having received CGFMU support.

To calculate this provision, the realizable value of any collateral should be subtracted from the outstanding balance that is covered by the ECGC guarantee.",
            "generated_answer": "For loans classified as 'doubtful' where guarantee has been invoked from ECGC under any scheme or programme, no provision need be made. If the loan account continues to remain 'doubtful', then normal provisions applicable to such accounts should be maintained even if payment has not yet been received from ECGC after invoking the guarantees. However, once payment is actually realized from ECGC, there will be no further requirement for maintaining provisions against these advances.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "For EMI-based floating rate personal loans, financial institutions are required to keep borrowers informed about how changes in benchmark interest rates could affect their EMIs or the length of their loan. They also need to communicate any changes to the EMI amount or the loan duration that result from interest rate adjustments. Borrowers must have the option to switch to a fixed interest rate, according to a Board-approved policy that specifies how often such a switch is allowed. Borrowers should also be able to choose to increase their EMI, extend the loan's term, or use a combination of both. Additionally, they should have the option to make partial or full prepayments at any time during the loan, in accordance with regulations on foreclosure charges. All charges for switching from a floating to a fixed rate, along with any other service or administrative fees, must be clearly disclosed in the loan sanction letter and whenever these charges are updated. Institutions need to make sure that extending the loan's term does not result in negative amortization. Borrowers should also receive a quarterly statement that includes details on the principal and interest recovered, the EMI amount, the number of EMIs still to be paid, and the annualized interest rate.",
            "generated_answer": "When a loan's repayment plan involves equidistant monthly installments or any other similar installment method for principal and/or interest repayments, banks should reset all floating interest rate benchmarks at least annually. This ensures transparency regarding future cash flows associated with such products. However, this practice does not apply if the EMI includes only equity financing from sources like family members or friends who have been advised against entering into such arrangements due to potential conflicts of interest. In cases where EMIs do include an element of debt finance, lenders may continue using their discretion concerning benchmark resets as previously exercised by regulators.

If a Self-Help Group (SHG) has members who are intentional defaulters, the group is still eligible for financing, provided that these intentional defaulters are excluded from the loan and the details are properly documented. Banks are also advised not to reject loan applications from SHGs simply because family members of individual SHG members have defaulted on loans.

The District Administration, along with the Lead Bank for the district, should jointly take initiative in these districts. Banks will be in charge of disbursing credit, and the State Government will be in charge of establishing a supportive environment, including rural infrastructure, that enables banks to lend money and recover debts. The concerned banks' corporate offices will receive progress updates at the district level, and bank Chairmen/Managing Directors will pay close attention to the progress.",
            "generated_answer": "In districts or sub-districts with a CD ratio less than 20%, credit institutions must formulate an action plan approved by their Boards. This plan requires agreement from State Governments/Chief Ministers for implementation at all levels within two months after approval. The Chief Minister's name and contact details should be provided as part of this strategy. Additionally, each district should have a Lead District Officer responsible for coordinating efforts between public sector banks and private commercial banks operating there, ensuring inter-bank coordination during review meetings under the district level consultative forum. A minimum one-day review meeting per month involving bank staff will also occur in these districts; other districts without a CD Ratio target may still conduct regular review meetings according to existing guidelines issued earlier.",

To guarantee punctual payments, banks should actively seek pension payment orders.

If these provisions are less than 20% of the NPA's outstanding amount, a 150% risk weight is applied. This is reduced to 100% if the provisions are 20% or more, and further reduced to 50% if they are 50% or more of the outstanding amount.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "When a bank contributes to a default fund that covers both products with settlement risk and those with counterparty credit risk, the capital required is calculated separately for each product that generates counterparty credit risk. If the Qualifying Central Counterparty's (QCCP) own prefunded resources are shared across different types of products, these resources must be allocated proportionally based on the exposure at default (EAD) specific to each product.",
            "generated_answer": "If a bank has an existing default fund that covers both products subject to settlement risk and those subject only to counterparty credit risk, the calculation involves determining 'prefunded exposure' as if all transactions were covered by the default fund against settlement risk. This results in a higher amount than what would be required solely due to counterparty credit risk; therefore, a portion equal to the minimum regulatory Capital Requirement calculated under the standardized approach should be deducted from the total.

This additional provisioning requirement is then allocated proportionally to each bank based on its funded exposure to the borrower.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "For Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks, the risk weight assigned to real estate exposure secured by mortgaged residential housing loans to individual borrowers varies based on the loan amount and the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. Specifically, a 50% risk weight applies to loans up to \u20b930.00 lakh where the LTV ratio is 75% or lower. A 75% risk weight is assigned to loans exceeding \u20b930.00 lakh with an LTV ratio of 75% or less. A 100% risk weight is applied when the LTV ratio exceeds 75%, regardless of the loan amount.",

Furthermore, should the second payment leg remain outstanding after five business days, the bank having made the initial payment is mandated to apply a risk weight of 1250% to the total transferred value, in addition to any applicable replacement costs.

            "generated_answer": "When making payments under non-Delivery vs. Payment (non-DvP), or free-delivery agreements where the bank's reciprocal payment has yet to be received by it, commercial banks must maintain their full regulatory requirements as if the transaction were an outright purchase/sale at all times until such time that the payment leg becomes irrevocable; otherwise, they will have inadequate Capital Adequacy. This also applies if there is no settlement mechanism available between two banks, even though one bank may own securities held by another through clearing systems. Banks should establish policies and procedures for determining whether transactions qualify as outright purchases/sales.

As an example, exposures backed by State Government guarantees are assigned a risk weight of 20 percent.",

The part of an exposure covered by eligible third-party credit derivatives has its own specific risk weighting requirements. For example, if a bank uses an external guarantee from another bank as additional security beyond collateral cover provided through repo arrangements, it can apply either the counterparty's credit risk weight to that portion after considering applicable haircut adjustments, or use 10% if no significant downgrade would occur due to events affecting only one party involved.

            "question": "Why do banks use stress testing, and what advantages does it provide for managing risk and planning capital?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "Stress testing is an essential method that banks use to manage risks by predicting possible negative effects associated with different types of risks. It enables banks to evaluate their capital requirements to withstand losses resulting from major economic or financial shocks. The benefits of stress testing include providing future-oriented risk evaluations, improving the shortcomings of models and historical information, aiding in communication, guiding capital and liquidity planning, establishing risk tolerance levels, handling risk concentrations, and enabling the creation of risk mitigation strategies.",
            "generated_answer": "Stress tests help banks understand how their balance sheets would react during adverse economic events. They can be used as part of an internal management tool or by regulators to assess the potential impact of extreme market movements or significant disruptions in markets on bank profitability, solvency, liquidity position, etc., leading them to anticipate problems earlier than otherwise might occur. Stress testing also assists supervisors in understanding different scenarios through which they may conduct regulatory reviews of individual institutions' exposures and other risks inherent within the various business lines. Furthermore, supervisory authorities often use results from such exercises when assessing whether additional capital should be maintained beyond minimum requirements due to higher-than-expected levels of systemic, residual, or reputational risk. Banks can present their Board with information gained via stress testing that helps explain potential weaknesses in the institution's operations, while stressing that these estimates serve only as tools rather than exact predictions. In addition, stress-testing analysis provides useful input into decision-making regarding contingency funding plans and strategies for dealing with asset quality deterioration. Finally, because a well-conceived framework can identify key sources of sensitivity at both firm-wide and line-of-business level, senior managers have access to critical data necessary to make decisions about strategic direction and appropriate actions required under stressed conditions.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "To mitigate risks associated with unsecured guarantees, Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks should ensure that their unsecured guarantee commitments are not excessively concentrated within particular customer segments or sectors. It is essential that the Board of Directors defines suitable limits for unsecured guarantees extended to individual customers. These limits should be determined by considering the ratio of total unsecured guarantees and the multiple of the customer's shareholdings in the bank.",
            "generated_answer": "To mitigate risks associated with concentrated unsecured guarantees, Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks must establish comprehensive guidelines for granting such guarantees. These guidelines should specify prudential limits linked to the bank's capital position relative to its Tier I or total capital. The board-approved policy should outline procedures that account executives can follow when dealing with individuals seeking unsecured guarantees. It also requires prior approval from two authorized officers if individual requests exceed established prudential limits. This ensures adequate monitoring by top management. In cases where multiple accounts under one guarantor reach the approved limit, additional safeguards like co-guaranteeing by another UCB may be required before approving further credit facilities beyond the initial limit.",

This requirement pertains specifically to their operations located within India.",
            "generated_answer": "Under the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCCB), which serves as an early warning mechanism against potential increases in credit risk during economic expansions, banks must hold additional capital. This buffer varies depending on regional exposure limits set by the RBI. Banks should assess their individual exposures relative to these limits each quarter; if they exceed 150% or fall below 75%, it triggers a CCCB requirement ranging from 20 basis points up to two percentage points above normal regulatory minimum capital requirements. For other states not meeting this criterion, there may be no CCCB applicable at all times due to consistently high or low state GDP growth rates over several years.",

The district administration and the lead bank should jointly adopt strategies for the district's improvement. Banks should concentrate on disbursing credit, while the state government should focus on developing rural infrastructure and a supportive environment for lending and loan recovery.",
            "generated_answer": "When preparing credit plans for districts where the Credit-Deposits Ratio (CD Ratio) falls below 65% or stays stagnant at less than 70%, special emphasis must be given. District Development Officers (DDOs), Regional Coordinators, and District Consultative Committee members from banks should identify specific areas causing low CD Ratios during monthly meetings and implement remedial measures as part of their strategy to increase lending. They may also consider setting sub-goals if needed within the overall target. For instance, some regions might have a CD Ratio goal higher than 14%. Banks should submit quarterly progress reports detailing actions towards achieving these goals through various schemes like PMJDY, SHG-Bank Linking Programmes, etc., including the number of new accounts opened, deposits collected under various government-sponsored Schemes, loans extended, interest rates offered, repayment performance compared to state average recovery levels, and any other factors relevant to increasing productivity and profitability of rural branches.

            "ground_truth_answer": "In securitization, implicit support arises when a bank offers financial assistance exceeding its contractual duties. This indicates to the market that the bank still bears the risks associated with the securitized assets. Because this type of support is not contractually required, it is not included in Pillar 1 calculations, it should be a component of the Pillar 2 process and integrated into a bank's Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).",
            "generated_answer": "When a bank provides indirect guarantees or commitments that investors rely upon but do not explicitly appear within formal documentation, this constitutes implicit support. This can include situations where market participants expect regulators to intervene if there's an issue with either credit quality or liquidity.

Banks are expected to co-accept only legitimate trade bills, verifying that the goods have been delivered to the borrower's inventory. It is important to confirm the accuracy of the valuation of goods on invoices and to avoid co-accepting accommodation bills. Discounting banks should assess the co-accepting bank's ability to meet the obligation and establish bank-specific limits for discounting co-accepted bills. Banks should also ensure that the co-acceptance liability aligns with their financial resources, regularly confirm the liabilities of co-accepting banks, maintain detailed records, and notify the co-accepting bank's main office of any disproportionate transactions. Branch managers are required to report co-acceptance commitments to their supervisory offices. Co-acceptances exceeding Rs.10,000 should require dual signatures from bank officials. For bills above Rs. 2 lakh, written confirmation from the accepting bank's supervisory office is mandatory, and bills exceeding Rs. 20 lakh for a single borrower necessitate prior approval from the co-accepting bank's head office.",
            "generated_answer": "When banks co-accept bills, they must establish procedures for identifying risks associated with the proposed exposures. This includes considering factors like the borrower's creditworthiness relative to the bill amount or other exposures by that customer at both the bank proposing co-acceptance and any other undertaking involved in financing activities. Banks may also use internal rating systems as an additional tool; however, external ratings alone cannot be relied upon due to potential limitations such as reliance on public information only, differing standards across agencies, varying methodologies between long-term/credit facility ratings and short term/demand guarantees/riskier facilities, lack of uniformity within the same agency over time, and possible conflicts of interest influencing grading practices.

            "ground_truth_answer": "When determining Common Equity Tier 1 capital, banks are required to fully reflect defined benefit pension fund liabilities on their balance sheet. Defined benefit pension fund assets should be subtracted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital, after accounting for any related deferred tax liability that would be eliminated if the asset were impaired or derecognized. These regulations are applicable to both the individual bank and its consolidated group, encompassing assets and liabilities related to subsidiaries.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks must account for all items included under 'net defined benefit pension plan liability' as per Accounting Standard - 20. This includes both cash outflows from Defined Benefit Pension Plans (DBPP) schemes that have been funded through surplus funds or other corporate resources, and any shortfall arising due to adverse changes in actuarial valuation which may not be compensated by future contributions. Furthermore, these amounts should also include the current year's net profit credited against the DBPL if it was previously deducted while computing profit before tax. These figures will be adjusted either directly within equity reserves held outside OCI, or indirectly via adjustments made during interim dividend announcements. The total amount after adjustment forms part of the Common Equity Tier 1 calculation; however, no further deductions are permitted unless otherwise specified.

            "ground_truth_answer": "For positions hedged using Credit Default Swaps (CDS), a bank can fully offset specific risk capital charges if the values of the CDS and the hedged position demonstrate consistent movement in opposite directions and to the same degree. This typically occurs when the CDS is an exact match for the hedged position. Banks may offset 80% of specific risk capital charges when the values of the CDS and the hedged position move in opposite directions, but not to the same degree. An example is a long cash position hedged by a CDS with an exact match in reference obligation and maturity. This partial offset is conditional on the absence of key features in the CDS that could cause significant price deviations.",
            "generated_answer": "When calculating credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risks associated with bilateral foreign currency interest rate swaps or foreign exchange forwards sold, banks may partially offset specific risk capital charges if they hold an eligible CDS that perfectly offsets their exposure. For this purpose, a fully collateralized net position exists when both legs have positive values at all times during trading hours; otherwise, it's considered only partly covered by the CDS. Banks can still use the full amount of mark-to-market gains from the CDS as capital deduction but must maintain 10% capital cushion derived solely from internal common equity held against the potential future decrease in value resulting from counterparty default over time. The remaining 90% is deducted via incremental leverage ratio buffer held exclusively through Common Equity Tier 1 instruments. If no netting occurs due to uncollateralised legs, the capital charge applies separately without any deductions. Partially covered transactions require specific treatment where the CVA delta calculation differs between assets and liabilities, leading to different results depending on whether one uses the full notional amounts or adjusted leg values after considering the impact of premiums paid/received and accrued/unpaid coupons.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "For a bank that is a clearing member of a Qualifying Central Counterparty (QCCP), a 2% risk weight is applied to the bank's trade exposure resulting from its own transactions in Over-the-Counter (OTC) derivatives, exchange-traded derivatives, and Securities Financing Transactions (SFTs) with the QCCP. The exposure amount is computed using the Current Exposure Method (CEM) for derivatives and the capital adequacy regulations for Repo and Reverse Repo-style transactions.",
            "generated_answer": "When banks serve as clearing members for a Qualifying Central Counterparty (QCCP), they must apply different risk weights depending on whether their transactions consist primarily of exchange-traded or OTC derivatives. For OTC derivative trades, the full trade exposure is determined using either bilateral netting sets or an internal mark-to-market approach. If these methods aren't applicable due to legal restrictions, regulatory intervention powers, collateral requirements, performance guarantees, close-out provisions, etc., only the portion subject to potential loss due to creditworthiness concerns receives a 1250% risk weighting; any remaining amounts receive a 900% risk-weighting. However, if the counterparty isn't considered eligible under Pillar 2A requirements, all exposures have a default risk equivalent rate of capital charge.

However, an authorized dealer (AD) bank can allow commission payments, remitted outward, up to a reasonable amount in exceptional cases. This is permissible only if the merchanting trade transaction (MTT) is fully completed, paying the commission does not cause the MTT to incur a loss, and the merchanting trader specifically requests it from the AD bank.",

However, this must occur only within 30 days from when the exporter was aware that export proceeds had been received or credited into their account; otherwise, it would be considered premature remittance.

The primary indicator is the credit-to-GDP gap, which is considered alongside Gross Non-Performing Asset (GNPA) growth. Additional indicators that may be considered include the incremental Credit-Deposit (C-D) ratio over a moving three-year period, the Industry Outlook (IO) assessment index, and the interest coverage ratio. The Reserve Bank of India retains the authority to use any combination of these indicators, in addition to the credit-to-GDP gap, when deciding on the CCCB.",

These indicators collectively help in gauging excessive lending activity during boom periods that might lead to asset quality deterioration or increase systemic risk. The weight assigned varies according to each indicator's role in assessing banks' balance sheet strength vis-a-vis macroeconomic conditions; however, only one indicator may be used for CCCB calculation if all available data suggests an identical direction. For instance, if both NPA trends and Credit Growth-Potential GDP differ significantly from their respective historical norms, the impact of these two factors could offset each other when calculating capital requirements. Thus, CCCB can be calculated using either Credit Growth Relative Potential GDP Deviation OR Net NPA Trend Deviation OR Gross NPA Trend Deviation as applicable, whichever provides maximum positive/minimum negative number.",

The main shareholders of the borrowing company are usually preferred as guarantors, instead of directors or managerial staff.",

This adjustment raises the ceiling by 100 basis points, establishing revised limits of 550 bps above the ARR for ECBs and 350 bps above the ARR for TCs. This modification is specifically applicable to ECBs and TCs that were initially linked to LIBOR and are undergoing a benchmark transition to ARRs.",

            "generated_answer": "Banks can only make repayment of their paid-up equity capital after obtaining prior approval from the Department of Regulation.

            "generated_answer": "Agency banks should ensure that branches handling pension payments have adequate staff trained by senior officials. They must also establish toll-free lines manned 24x7 during normal office hours at all branches involved in pension disbursal, providing assistance even outside working hours through inter-bank arrangements or other means like SMS/GSM technology. Banks should regularly monitor these services' quality, ensuring timely responses to complaints from customers, pensioners, Nodal Officers, District Collectors, Revenue Authorities, State Pension Sanctioning Authorities, and National Pension System authorities. A system should be established where aggrieved citizens can contact either their Regional Office or SRO/COO directly regarding any grievance they might hold against bank officials responsible for pension payment operations. If an officer does not respond satisfactorily within one hour after being contacted via telephone, e-mail, letter, etc., the person contacting them may forward it to the respective regional offices of the concerned agencies for resolution. The receiving authority must inform the complainant about action taken upon complaint receipt; if unresolved, the complainant has recourse available as per existing RTI guidelines. Finally, branches involved in pension disbursal must display board notifications containing detailed instructions/information concerning pensioner's queries, along with details of the toll free number for customer support and a list of nodal officers/offices.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "The \"Price / Yield range setting\" feature available on the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) e-Kuber platform enables participants in the Government Securities (G-Sec) market to specify an acceptable high and low value for their auction bids. This range, definable in terms of either price or yield, applies to each security within each auction. This functionality serves to automatically check bids against the pre-defined limits, thereby mitigating the risk of errors, such as \"fat-finger\" or \"big-figure\" mistakes, in Government Securities auctions.",
            "generated_answer": "To enhance transparency during auctions and facilitate efficient pricing discovery across different segments within auction sessions, banks participating directly or indirectly through agents can use the \"Price/Yield Range Setting Facility.\" This allows them to input maximum and minimum bid amounts per price/yield point. When multiple bids are submitted at various yields/prices throughout an auction session, only the highest yield/bid amount accepted by the Auction Manager will be considered valid, while other prices/points may still remain active until all orders have been processed.

This is based on the fair value, which is derived from the prices or Yield to Maturity (YTM) of Central Government securities with similar tenors, as published by Financial Benchmarks India Private Ltd (FBIL). The resulting fair value is then adjusted to reflect the amortization of any premium or discount between the date of acquisition and March 31, 2024. This adjustment determines the revised carrying value of the securities.",
            "generated_answer": "When banks switch over to the new framework for investing in Special Securitized Assets created under schemes like GSARMA 2.0 or any other scheme approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), they must determine their current acquisition costs as per existing accounting practices.

            "ground_truth_answer": "According to Basel III guidelines, a bank can include minority interest from common shares issued by a fully consolidated subsidiary in its Common Equity Tier 1 capital only when the shares meet the requirements for common share classification and the subsidiary is also a bank. The amount recognized is the total minority interest less any surplus Common Equity Tier 1 capital held by the subsidiary that is attributable to minority shareholders. Surplus Common Equity Tier 1 capital is determined by subtracting the lower of two amounts from the subsidiary's total Common Equity Tier 1 capital: either the subsidiary's minimum Common Equity Tier 1 requirement plus its capital conservation buffer (which equals 8.0% of the subsidiary's risk-weighted assets), or the portion of the consolidated minimum requirement plus buffer (8.0% of consolidated risk-weighted assets) that corresponds to the subsidiary. The portion of the surplus attributable to minority shareholders is calculated by multiplying the surplus by the percentage of Common Equity Tier 1 owned by those shareholders.",
            "generated_answer": "Under Basel III requirements for banks operating globally, if an issuer's equity instruments meet all conditions specified within paragraph A.3.5.20(8), any minority interest arising due to common shares held by subsidiaries can be included as part of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.

            "ground_truth_answer": "System-based asset classification involves the automated categorization of a bank's assets by its computerized systems, following guidelines set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). This automated process includes both downgrading and upgrading asset classifications. While system-based classification is mandatory for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) meeting certain criteria, other UCBs are encouraged to adopt it voluntarily.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks must adopt an automated or semi-automated system for implementing the Asset Classification System. This system requires that all data be input into computerized systems at least once daily so that automatic computations can generate classified categories. The Reserve Bank defines specific parameters such as 'outstanding amount', 'period overdue' ('PO'), and 'permissible limit' (PL), which serve as inputs for these calculations. These definitions provide precise instructions regarding how assets should be classified automatically within each bank's information technology framework. Banks may use different abbreviations from those used by RBI but must map their own codes back to the same meaning when reporting asset classifications under Return 05.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "In the context of reporting international transactions, the 'Record type' field serves to identify whether the payment originated from a resident or a non-resident. Specifically, a 'Record type' value of '01' indicates an international payment made by a resident, and the card or UPI transaction issuing bank is responsible for reporting this transaction. Conversely, a 'Record type' value of '02' signifies a payment made by a non-resident, which should be reported by the acquiring bank.",

A value greater than zero signifies that the transaction represents an outgoing payment from a resident's account; otherwise, it denotes an incoming receipt for a resident. For example, if a person residing within India sends money abroad through internet banking, this would be recorded as '01 - Payment'. Conversely, when someone outside India initiates a transfer into their domestic bank account via netbanking, it will be classified under '87 \u2013 Receipt'.

            "ground_truth_answer": "A bank can acknowledge a Credit Default Swap (CDS) as a hedge for banking book positions when the exposure to the underlying asset is substituted by the protection seller's exposure, given that operational requirements are satisfied, the risk weight of the protection seller is less than that of the underlying asset, and there isn't a maturity mismatch. If these stipulations are not satisfied, the bank is required to factor in the exposure on the underlying asset and shift the CDS position to the trading book.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks can consider a CDS contract executed by them or any third party as an effective hedge against credit risk only when it fully covers all aspects of counterparty exposure. If this condition isn't met but the bank still uses the CDS as collateral to manage its exposures under the Standardised Approach using 'credit valuation adjustment' methodology, no regulatory capital benefits will be provided. However, banks must ensure they meet all relevant requirements regarding haircuts, maturity matching, and other applicable guidelines before applying such measures. The specific terms agreed upon between two parties should govern their actions; however, a lack of explicit provisions does not automatically invalidate potential hedging mechanisms unless there's evidence suggesting otherwise from the documentation available.",

Inter-Government Agreements (IGAs), established between the U.S. and other nations, streamline FATCA implementation. This includes simplifying the registration and reporting obligations for financial institutions operating within those participating countries.",

This global initiative facilitates compliance monitoring for both domestic institutions handling these accounts as well as non-resident entities holding such accounts. To facilitate FATCA implementation smoothly without imposing duplicative reporting burdens, agreements between the United States Treasury Department's Office of International Affairs and other countries' competent authorities establish streamlined procedures known as IGAs. These IGAs allow covered financial institutions located within the jurisdiction of the signatory country to fulfill FATCA requirements through an agreement with its own government rather than directly engaging with the U.S., thereby simplifying cross-border financial transactions while ensuring adherence to international standards against money laundering, terrorist financing activities, tax evasion, corruption, and proliferation funding.",

This contract must establish a single legal obligation encompassing all transactions involved. This ensures that if the counterparty defaults due to events like bankruptcy or liquidation, the bank is entitled to receive or obligated to pay only the net sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values of the included transactions. Furthermore, the bank must maintain documented legal opinions confirming that relevant courts and administrative bodies would acknowledge the bank's exposure as a net amount under the laws of the counterparty's jurisdiction, the laws governing the transactions, and the laws governing the netting contract. The bank should also implement procedures for regularly reviewing the legal characteristics of these netting arrangements, considering potential changes in the relevant laws.",

However, CDS that only provide cover when there's actually been a default cannot reduce provisioning needs; such CDS must be deducted from Tier I Capital, but not from total assets. This deduction applies even if the bonds have been upgraded out of special mention category due solely to the presence of CDS. For temporary ratings below investment grade where downgrading would trigger immediate payment obligations, no deductions apply until the downgrade occurs within six months after issuance. The full amount of CDS payments received should then be subtracted from profits over time, considering any tax consequences arising during the life of the instrument. When computing debt-equity ratios involving instruments like Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI) issued before March 2009, the CDS component is treated as equity.",

Claims on commercial banks located within these countries must also adhere to specified criteria regarding capital adequacy standards relative to Basel III norms. If no information exists about regulatory compliance concerning minimum Capital to Risk Weighted Asset Ratio (CRAR) requirements, an additional 20 percentage point risk weight applies due to concerns over potential under-capitalization risks associated with lending to emerging market economies.

The objective is to confirm that the risk weights allocated according to the Standardised Approach adequately represent the actual risk associated with these exposures. In instances where a bank concludes that the intrinsic risk of an exposure, particularly one lacking a credit rating, is notably greater than the risk weight suggests, the bank is expected to factor in this heightened credit risk in its overall evaluation of capital adequacy. Banks with advanced systems should include risk rating systems, portfolio analysis and aggregation, securitization and complex credit derivatives, and large exposures and risk concentrations in their credit review assessment of capital adequacy.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks must assess all exposure types when evaluating their capital requirements. This includes considering both gross positions across single counterparties or groups/sub-groups and netted transactions like collateral arrangements or credit derivatives within an internal portfolio. Banks should use techniques that align closely with market practices if they choose not to apply standardized approaches from regulatory guidelines. The methodology's accuracy depends on assumptions about future events; while forward-looking methods may seem superior due to lower risk weights than historical averages, they can also lead to underestimations as they might ignore potential structural risks or shocks in underlying markets. For instance, extreme events can cause sudden losses exceeding expectations derived solely through backtesting against historic data alone.

For bilateral OTC contracts, it also includes collateral received at least quarterly over time horizons ranging up to 10 days depending upon currency pair, maturity date, size, liquidity etc., ensuring no gap between valuation and final payment when marking transactions to value instead of model-based forecasts.

            "ground_truth_answer": "In situations where a natural disaster diminishes the ability of individuals to repay their debts, existing crop loans, agricultural term loans, and any accumulated interest may be transformed into term loans with revised repayment schedules. The repayment schedule for such restructured loans generally spans three to five years but could be extended to a maximum of seven years, or, under exceptional circumstances, up to ten years. It is advisable to consider a moratorium period of a minimum of one year, and banks should refrain from demanding extra collateral for these restructured loans. Restructured crop loans are regarded as current obligations and are not categorized as non-performing assets (NPA).

These reserves can be used to absorb financial losses during economic downturns. If these capital conservation buffers are reduced, banks should replenish them by decreasing discretionary distributions, including dividend payments, share repurchases, and employee bonuses. Banks may also choose to raise additional capital from financial markets.",

Banks can also boost their Common Equity Tier 1 ratio by retaining profits or issuing additional instruments that qualify as CET1 under regulatory guidelines. To address temporary shortfalls caused by exceptional events such as natural disasters, banks may distribute dividends after building up reserves during normal periods. For long-term deficits due to economic downturns, regulators will consider whether banks need an orderly reduction plan approved before any dividend distribution occurs. If these measures prove insufficient, authorities have the discretion to limit distributions until they believe capital levels are sufficient.",

Borrowing from Notice Money market should be considered an additional liability beyond net demand time liabilities while computing risk assets. However, this limit can include borrowing up to Rs 2 crore without prior board approval but only for short-term liquidity purposes, subject to adherence to existing regulatory requirements pertaining to inter-bank fund transfers through RTGS system. For Term Money Markets, the maximum amount borrowed shall depend upon the tenor selected viz., overnight, next day settlement, two days settlement etc.. The above mentioned ceiling on borrowing will automatically get reset at the start of each new financial year i.e., April Ist every year.

These measures can include advising the UCB to present an Action Plan, approved by its Board, aimed at reinstating profitability or offsetting accumulated losses. The RBI might also direct the UCB's Board of Directors to assess the advancement of the Action Plan, disallow the disbursement of dividends or donations, put a ceiling on capital expenditures exceeding a defined threshold, and enforce strategies to curtail interest, operational, and administrative costs.",
            "generated_answer": "When a UCB identifies recurring problems leading to unprofitability like ongoing financial loss or accumulation of deficit in financial statements, it must report these issues immediately. The bank's Board should review management practices promptly by setting performance standards, assessing credit quality using risk weights for capital adequacy, evaluating loan recoveries considering asset classification norms, analyzing provisions held against advances, reviewing net profit margins relative to industry peers, monitoring changes in interest income and expenses due to fluctuations in borrowing costs and interest rates, examining fee-based incomes and other non-interest incomes, ensuring accurate depreciation calculations that do not overstate profits, verifying tax credits and deductions claimed accurately without duplication or omission, conducting an audit annually according to statutory requirements, and preparing complete balance sheets free from any omissions or misstatements at year-end. If reported to be unprofitable, the Reserve Bank may direct specific actions depending on the circumstances, including advising directors to resign if their conduct contributed significantly to poor governance resulting in continued unprofitability, mandating mandatory replacement of all members of the board within six months unless reformed under Section 57(2)(d), restricting dividend payments, increasing provisioning levels beyond regulatory minimums until profitability improves, limiting branch expansion plans, requiring increased net worth through share capital increase or reserves transfer, imposing restrictions on executive perks and allowances during resolution period, reducing staff strength by freezing recruitment until profitability is restored, curtailing loans and advances growth until positive results occur, prohibiting new branches, mergers, consolidations or acquisitions until recovery takes place, issuing additional shares only after restoring profitability, maintaining excess cash balances with regulators until turnaround occurs, subjecting senior executives' remuneration packages to approval before implementation, providing incentives linked solely to improved financial position rather than short-term gains, instituting regular supervisory visits and reviews led by top officials from host offices, implementing stringent internal controls systems approved by external auditors, directing submission of monthly certificates from qualified independent chartered accountants confirming compliance with prudential guidelines, instructing submission of interim financial statements quarterly accompanied by projections showing expected restoration of viability parameters, requesting detailed action plans outlining measures intended to restore profitable operations quickly; failure to execute agreed upon remedial proposals will result in further corrective actions being initiated; authorizing early closure/liquidation if no improvement prospects exist despite attempts made previously; terminating business licenses obtained via false representations regarding solvency status; revoking banking license if persistent contraventions persist even post-remediation efforts undertaken earlier fail; granting permission to seek advice from professionals outside government-appointed personnel concerning managerial arrangements required to address",

It includes representatives from all commercial banks operating within that state's jurisdiction, along with key government departments such as Finance or Economic Affairs Departments. The SLBC functions at both state-wide levels and district-level sub-committees known as District Consultative Committees (DCC). These committees facilitate coordination among public sector banks for resource allocation decisions by state governments involving these banks. In states without a Department of Banks, lead bank responsibilities are assumed by the department concerned with finance matters. The chairmanship rotates annually amongst the bankers present at each meeting, following a fixed schedule determined at the commencement of the year. A representative from the RBI's Regional Office participates ex-officio. While scheduled commercial banks participate actively due to their role in credit flow, non-scheduled primary and rural cooperative societies may also be invited if relevant discussions pertain to them. Non-government officers, like representatives from NABARD, can attend meetings when appropriate but cannot vote unless specifically mentioned. Regularly convened SLBC/DCC meetings allow members to discuss progress towards achieving targets set during planning exercises conducted at various stages throughout the fiscal year.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "If a loan is sold to an Asset Reconstruction Company (ARC) at a price exceeding its net book value (NBV), the excess provision can be credited to the Profit and Loss Account during the year of the sale, provided that the sale consideration consists exclusively of cash and Security Receipts (SRs) backed by a guarantee from the Government of India. Nevertheless, the portion of the consideration received in SRs must be deducted from CET 1 capital, and dividends cannot be distributed from this specific portion.",

This reversal should occur by crediting the profit and loss account at one-third intervals over three accounting periods starting from June 30 or December 31 following the date of transfer, whichever comes first, provided no defaults have occurred during that period. These amounts can then be utilized towards maintaining Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR).

This deduction is made after accounting for any related deferred tax liabilities that would be eliminated if the intangible assets faced impairment or were derecognized, following established accounting standards.

This extension was effective for three months, specifically from April 1, 2021, to June 30, 2021.",
            "generated_answer": "The Interest Equalization Scheme was extended until December 31, 2021. For exporters availing pre-shipment rupee export credits from banks or NBFCs between January 05, 2021, and March 31, 2021, interest equalisation will be provided at rates specified under Annex I. For exports completed during this period but claimed later due to delayed submission of claims by beneficiaries, interest equalisation can still occur if all other conditions stipulated earlier remain valid.

This calculation is based on the Tier-I capital as of March 31 of the preceding year, following deductions for goodwill, Deferred Tax Assets (DTA), and other intangible assets, and prior to any deductions for equity investment in subsidiaries. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may permit exceeding this limit if the PDI issuance is part of a UCB's revival or financial restructuring plan.",
            "generated_answer": "When determining Tier I capital for UCBs that issue Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI), certain provisions must be adhered to. Firstly, any PDI included within the issued amount should not include amounts representing payments or contributions towards other components of capital such as reserves, surplus funds, preference shares, redeemable non-cumulative preference shares, deferred equity instruments, etc., which would otherwise qualify under specific categories. Secondly, only one instrument can be included at a time; if an additional instrument is created after existing ones have been utilized, it cannot replace them until all previous instruments mature by conversion into equity shares. Thirdly, banks issuing multiple instruments are required to disclose this fact publicly before issuance takes place. Finally, any PDI already counted toward Tier 1 Capital cannot be used again even upon maturity/convertion, unless there was no breach of regulatory requirements during its tenure and it has met all specified criteria.",

They must meet specific conditions regarding conversion or redemption terms, but can include provisions for periodic resetting of coupon rates if these resets occur periodically after 5 years from issuance. PNCPS issued by banks without these reset features may still qualify for inclusion under Tier I capital at an upper limit of 10% of total risk-weighted assets. However, any portion exceeding this amount will not be considered when determining Tier I capital adequacy requirements; instead, it would be deducted from Total Capital. If no future coupons were due during a period, such as due to arrears resulting from non-payment obligations, they would reduce Tier I capital accordingly.

Based on the latest update, these rates amount to 8.65 percent or 10.65 percent, correspondingly.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "If a bank's aggregate investments in unconsolidated banking, financial, and insurance entities surpasses 10% of its Common Equity Tier 1 capital, the amount exceeding this threshold is subject to deduction. This deduction follows a corresponding approach, meaning it's applied to the same capital component (Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, or Tier 2) that would be applicable if the bank directly issued the capital. The deduction from each capital tier is proportional to the holdings in that tier as a percentage of total capital holdings. Any shortfall in a specific tier is deducted from the next higher tier.",
