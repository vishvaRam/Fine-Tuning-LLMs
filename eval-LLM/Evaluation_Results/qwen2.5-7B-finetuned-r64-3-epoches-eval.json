            "ground_truth_answer": "For the purpose of calculating Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, Non-Banking Financial Companies - Upper Layer (NBFC-UL) are required to deduct the total value of goodwill and other intangible assets, considering any related deferred tax liabilities.",
            "generated_answer": "For Non-Banking Financial Companies - Upper Layer (NBFC-UL), the full amount of goodwill and all other intangible assets must be deducted from the NBFC's total balance sheet assets when calculating its Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR). This deduction should follow specific guidelines. However, if an NBFC uses ICAI/IFCIR standards for deducting these items, they may not have to provide additional details unless required otherwise. In any case, disclosures regarding unamortized deferred tax assets and provisions made against long-term investments due to market value depreciation need to be included under 'Other Disclosures'.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "In instances where a bank is found to have provided implicit support to a securitization structure on more than one occasion, the regulatory consequences include a mandatory public disclosure of the violation. Additionally, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may take further actions, such as disallowing the bank from obtaining preferential capital treatment for its securitized assets. The RBI might also mandate the bank to allocate capital against all securitized assets as if the bank had explicitly committed to them. Furthermore, the bank could be required to treat all securitized assets as if they were still part of its balance sheet when calculating capital, and the RBI could demand that the bank maintain regulatory capital beyond the minimum risk-based capital ratios.",
            "generated_answer": "When a bank provides implicit support multiple times beyond one instance during its life cycle for a security issued by an entity where it holds structured deposits or other forms of debt financing, the Reserve Bank of India may subject the bank's exposures arising from previous instances of implicit support to strict scrutiny. This could result in the inclusion of such exposures under the definition of Regulatory Adjusted Capital (RAROC). Additionally, any future implicit support will be treated as a violation of regulatory guidelines.

However, when classifying an advance due to temporary difficulties like insufficient drawing power or stock levels, banks can restructure credit facilities without immediately categorizing them as NPAs. This allows for continued monitoring until regular repayment resumes. Drawing power must be reinstated once sufficient stocks are available. If there's no improvement after six months despite genuine efforts, the assets will then be classified as NPAs.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "When a clearing member receives collateral from a client for trades cleared on behalf of that client, and then transfers that collateral to a Qualifying Central Counterparty (QCCP), the clearing member is permitted to recognize the collateral for both the transaction between the QCCP and the clearing member, and the transaction between the clearing member and the client. Consequently, the initial margins provided by clients to clearing members are eligible to reduce the clearing member's exposure to those clients.",
            "generated_answer": "When a bank collects collateral from its clients for client cleared transactions and then provides this collateral to a Qualifying Central Counter Party (QCCP), the bank must recognize any credit risk associated with potential losses due to either counterparty default or changes in market value. The amount recognized depends on whether specific provisions exist under applicable laws governing securities financing transactions; if such conditions apply, no exposure should be recognized against cash received as margin unless it is segregated at the QCCPs level only. If these legal conditions do not apply, an exposure equal to the fair value of the transaction will arise because the bank has exposed itself to the risks inherent in providing funds while receiving potentially less valuable collateral. This may result in two exposures: one towards the client based on net replacement cost (NRC) adjusted for eligibility of variation margins provided by them, and another towards the QCCP representing the difference between the NRC calculated without deducting variation margins held by third parties but including legally possible variations arising out of re-margining requirements post default.",

(ECGC) as a risk mitigation strategy and may consider setting up dedicated limits for the issuance of bid bonds.",

They should also waive penal charges for non-acceptance due to reasons beyond exporters' control during pre-contractual obligations. However, penalties must be charged if defaults occur after contract execution. Banks should ensure adequate cover by employers/owners and obtain written assurances from them regarding prompt payment even if contractors default.

The responsibilities of these GMCTAs include assaying and refining gold received from depositors. They also manage the vaulting and transportation of the refined gold to banks, in accordance with the agreements set in place. The designated banks are authorized to pay a maximum of 1.5% as incentive or handling charges to the GMCTAs in return for the services rendered.",
            "generated_answer": "Under the Gold Monetization Scheme, authorized gold refineries designated as GMCTAs by banks can receive physical gold from customers. These agents must use testing equipment that meets IS 14759-2008 standards or better at all branches where they accept gold deposits under this scheme; no additional charges beyond standard storage costs may be levied if the customer opts not to have the gold tested per these guidelines. Refineries approved to handle gold bullion received through KITCO will follow separate instructions issued specifically regarding bullion refinement procedures within the KITCO network. The cost associated with refining gold is borne by the depositor. After processing according to established norms, refined gold bars should undergo hallmarking before being credited back into individual accounts. Banks determine payment terms for deposited gold, which typically align closely with prevailing market prices. Interest payments vary among different GMCTAs participating in the program but generally adhere to specified guidelines.\n\nBanks compensate GMCTAs through a performance-based approach linked to actual work done: a fixed fee plus variable incentives capped at \u20b93 lakhs per year. However, this incentive is limited solely to the first three years of contract duration. For gold deposits up to 8 kgs made between April 26th, 2015, and December 31st, 2015, the payout was restricted to only two months' interest during a six-month period post-deposit maturity. In cases involving damaged or rejected gold unfit for further sale/refining due to contamination/damage/defects, no compensation would be provided even after meeting minimum quality specifications, although affected depositors could still avail themselves of other compensatory benefits offered under the scheme's terms.

            "ground_truth_answer": "For foreign banks operating in India, the classification of capital as common equity for regulatory purposes requires that it represents the most subordinated claim in the event of the bank's liquidation within India. The capital should entitle the holder to a proportional claim on residual assets after all senior claims have been satisfied. The principal of this capital should be perpetual, repaid only upon liquidation or with approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Distributions to the head office must be derived from distributable items, and not tied to the amount paid at issuance or subject to contractual caps, unless distributions exceed distributable items. These distributions are permissible only after all legal and contractual obligations, including payments to more senior capital instruments, have been fulfilled, ensuring no preferential treatment. This form of capital must absorb the first and largest share of any losses incurred and must be clearly presented in the bank's balance sheet.",
            "generated_answer": "For regulatory purposes, items included under Common Equity Tier 1 should meet specific criteria. These include being issued by the issuing entity or its consolidated subsidiaries; representing ownership interest in the issuer that takes precedence over other perpetual instruments held at issuance, except where explicitly stated otherwise; being fully paid up without any restrictions preventing redemption; not having contractual obligations from which the holder cannot escape unless liquidation occurs; ensuring distributions aren't linked to the amount received previously nor capped below previous payments; prohibiting variable payment amounts tied to external factors like dividends, profits, earnings or share price; and requiring principal losses absorbability through either loss absorption provisions or substantial depreciation. Non-cumulative Perpetual Debt Instruments also have additional requirements regarding dividend/redeem-payment non-occurrence if net profit isn't positive/CRAR falls short of minimum requirement after distribution/payment respectively.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "A bank's investment in Tier 2 debt instruments issued by other banks and financial institutions is included when calculating the 10% limit on cross-holdings of capital among banks and financial institutions. The risk weight for these investments is determined by the relevant capital adequacy regulations.",
            "generated_answer": "When calculating capital adequacy at both individual and consolidated levels, a bank must deduct investments made by itself or its subsidiaries in Tier 2 Debt Instruments issued by other regulated entities. This deduction applies even if such instruments meet eligibility criteria for classification as Tier 1 Capital under Basel III guidelines. These deductions should be applied towards any shortfall identified when meeting minimum regulatory requirements. If no shortfalls exist, then the full amount invested will reduce Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1). For risk-weighting purposes, credit conversion factors apply; however, an additional 2% risk weight may also need to be assigned beyond what would normally be warranted due to lack of collateral. The resulting net position after these adjustments can only qualify up to a maximum limit that is 0.4 percentage points lower than the overall minimum requirement applicable to them individually or within the group respectively. Banks cannot circumvent this requirement simply by issuing such instruments solely intended for internal transfers between group companies. Additionally, holdings exceeding 10 percent of their respective Tier 2 capital are subject to a further cap reduction which depends upon the excess extent over 10%.",

This exclusion persists until the bank's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio reaches 8% without relying on the replenished equity.

            "generated_answer": "If a bank breaches its PONV trigger by virtue of issuing new shares after breaching it initially at issuance without converting or writing down any other element of regulatory capital, then that breach will be treated as an event triggering all loss absorbing requirements. Any increase in Common Equity resulting from share issues may be used for dividend payments once the bank reaches the minimum CET1 ratio applicable under Pillar 2. However, this does not apply when the reserve fund has been depleted due to losses incurred during operation; rather, funds injected into the bank through public sector injection can only be distributed back to existing shareholders via dividends once the bank meets regulatory norms and conditions set forth by regulators.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "The net worth of an entity is calculated by summing the equity share capital, preference shares that are compulsorily convertible into equity capital, free reserves, share premium account, and capital reserves that represent surplus arising from the sale proceeds of assets. From this total, subtract revaluation reserves, accumulated losses, the book value of intangible assets, and deferred revenue expenditure to arrive at the net worth.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "The total penalty for violating regulations regarding the issuance of guarantees, not including reporting violations, is calculated by adding a fixed penalty of INR 500,000 for each regulation violated in the compounding application and a variable penalty based on how long the violation lasted. This variable penalty is a percentage of the amount involved in the violation, starting at 0.050% for violations lasting less than a year and increasing to 0.075% for violations lasting five years or longer. Notably, if the violation involves issuing guarantees to raise loans that are then reinvested in India, the potential penalty may be tripled.",
            "generated_answer": "The compounding amount may be determined as per sub-regulation (10), paragraph 4. The computation of interest is governed by regulation 8(2)(a). For breaches involving capital funds or working capital margins prescribed under Section 36A of Act I of 1957 read with Rule IV of Schedule II to that act, the calculation follows paragraphs 5(a) & b. If there's more than one violation within three years against the same guidelines, the maximum permitted penalty applies; otherwise, penalties accumulate if multiple contraventions occur during this period.

These transactions can occur via the bank's Indian branches, their respective IBUs, or their overseas branches. For foreign banks operating within India, this encompasses any branch of the parent bank.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks licensed in India that possess an Authorised Dealer Category-I license under FEMA 1999 can offer over-the-counter foreign exchange derivatives involving the Rupee as a currency or otherwise. These deals must be executed through their foreign branches/bank's overseas operation centers or offshore offices/centres of such banks located outside India. Transactions between two resident entities cannot qualify as NDDCs execution. However, an AD bank may permit its constituent branch operating inside India to undertake hedging of export receipts earned by it and/or its group constituents towards export from India, facilitated via placement of trades with other foreign branches of the same bank or any overseas centre of the parent bank of such AD bank. The hedge should be undertaken within thirty days of receipt of such export proceeds and only against future price movements of the concerned currencies; however, if the transaction has been opened beyond this stipulated period, then also, such entity can participate in OTC derivative products offered by AD Cat I banks mentioned above acting as market makers subject to conditions prescribed at para 2(a). Also, in case the exporter does not have access to any AD bank which allows them to buy hedges using the instruments specified hereinabove, they will be allowed to approach any AD bank authorized under Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 for availing the services of Non Deliverable Derivative Contracts(NDDC) /Foreign Currency Futures(CFD/FX futures)/Foreign Currency Options(FX options), provided the AD bank provides such facilities according to terms and conditions prescribed at sub paragraph B(ii)(a)-(iii).

            "ground_truth_answer": "For the valuation of gold ornaments intended for pledging, Urban Co-operative Banks are required to designate a certified jeweller or shroff as an appraiser. To protect their interests, the bank should secure a guarantee from the appraiser, which may include a cash deposit and an indemnity bond. It is preferable that the assessment and valuation be conducted on the bank's premises. However, if the valuation must occur off-site, the bank is responsible for implementing safety measures against potential loss while the items are in transit. These precautions should include transporting the ornaments in a secured, locked container, with both the appraiser and the bank holding keys, and the consignment accompanied by a bank employee and the borrower. Furthermore, the bank should arrange for insurance coverage to protect against any potential loss of the gold ornaments during transit.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "In the wake of a natural disaster, banks have several alternative options for enabling affected individuals to open new accounts. These methods include: introduction by an existing customer who is KYC-compliant, submission of documents such as a Voter's Identity Card or a driving license accompanied by address verification, endorsement by two neighbors who possess valid documentation, or any other form of evidence acceptable to the bank. These alternative procedures are applicable provided that the account balance does not surpass \u20b950,000 or the amount of relief provided (whichever is greater), and the total amount credited to the account within a year does not exceed \u20b91,00,000 or the relief amount disbursed (whichever is greater).",
            "generated_answer": "In situations where normal documentary requirements for account openings may be difficult due to disruptions caused by disasters like floods or earthquakes, banks should adopt flexible measures. These include obtaining necessary documents at later stages after ensuring that sufficient safeguards have been put into place; verifying customer identities before providing services such as credit facilities even if official documentation isn't available immediately; making use of additional information sources like Aadhaar, Voter ID Cards, PAN cards, mobile numbers, fingerprints, satellite imagery, and ration card details; establishing joint guarantor arrangements when dealing with affected persons who lack assets but require assistance for business resumption or livelihood re-establishment; offering concessional loan amounts tailored specifically to their needs; considering local community recommendations regarding borrower credibility; maintaining vigilance against fraudulent practices while being sensitive towards genuine beneficiaries seeking relief from distress. Banks must also follow KYC guidelines issued by other relevant regulatory bodies.",

For urban renewal schemes undertaken by Urban Development Authorities, banks should ensure sufficient revenue streams exist to cover loan servicing obligations. Additionally, lending institutions must maintain strict control over project execution timeframes; if delays occur due to administrative issues beyond contractors' control after an initial extension period, additional interest may be levied against the account holders.

            "ground_truth_answer": "Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) that are classified as Category - I Authorised Dealer Banks are required to follow the due diligence guidelines specified in A.P. (DIR Series) Circular No. 18, which was issued on October 04, 2024. These guidelines pertain to non-resident guarantees obtained by residents of India, and include verifying the authenticity and purpose of the guarantee, evaluating the financial health of the non-resident providing the guarantee, and confirming adherence to all relevant foreign exchange regulations.",
            "generated_answer": "Category-I Authorised Dealers must adhere to standard procedures when dealing with non-resident guaranteed borrowings. This includes ensuring that repayment obligations arise solely from the borrower's own funds or resources, preventing asset sequestration by foreign creditors at any point during loan servicing, avoiding encroachment upon restricted loans through these guarantees, and maintaining compliance even if other security has been waived. The bank should also verify that there will be no adverse impact on the borrowing entity's operations. Additionally, banks need to ensure they do not face restrictions under Section 10(2)(c), clause (ii) of FEMA regarding credit facilities granted against Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs). They may require an undertaking from borrowers to secure their liabilities separately without relying on guarantee coverage. Furthermore, banks should establish suitable arrangements with customers who have availed guarantees, such as margin accounts, cash margins, performance bonds, letters of credit, insurance cover, or similar forms of collateralization. Finally, banks must obtain periodic certification confirming continued adherence to established guidelines after each payment of principal or interest resulting from invoked guarantees.\n\nThe above mentioned measures should be applied similarly while handling Guarantees issued by overseas entities on behalf of Indian Residents including NBFCs.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "A working capital account is categorized as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA) if there are irregular drawings for a continuous duration of 90 days. This classification applies regardless of the borrower's financial health. Furthermore, an account is also designated as an NPA if regular or temporary credit limits are not reviewed or made permanent within 180 days from either the due date or the date the temporary limit was approved.",
            "generated_answer": "When the outstanding balance in a working capital account consistently exceeds the sanctioned limits for 90 days due to fund withdrawal exceeding replenishment through sales proceeds or additional credit, it becomes an NPA. Additionally, if drawings exceed the sanctioned limit by more than \u20b91 lakh but do not qualify under sub-section (4), the account will be treated as an NPA if any amount remains unpaid for two crop seasons after the stipulated time for repayment. For term loans, non-renewal beyond three months from maturity date also classifies them into NPAs. Finally, regular renewal of cash credits/overdrafts without evaluation within one month of expiry results in these accounts being categorized as NPAs.",

Furthermore, these guarantees are useful when delays occur in creating a charge on the company's assets, thus covering the period between the loan disbursement and the establishment of the charge. Personal guarantees are also relevant when a company's financial statements indicate funds are intertwined with other related entities.",
            "generated_answer": "Personal guarantees from directors or other individuals can be advantageous if they instill greater confidence among banks regarding the management's commitment. This is especially true during periods where economic conditions may hinder repayment. Additionally, personal guarantees can mitigate concerns about restrictive clauses within loan agreements that impede prompt cash generation by the company. However, it should not be assumed that guarantees will automatically lead to asset creation without due diligence. When dealing with closely held public limited companies, personal guarantees become more essential as their creditworthiness assessment relies heavily on information provided by existing shareholders.

            "ground_truth_answer": "For banks, liquidity risk involves the potential challenges of converting assets into cash or securing sufficient funding to cover their financial commitments. To manage this risk, banks should thoroughly examine their funding sources and how they use these funds, gain a deep understanding of funding market dynamics, and evaluate the efficacy of their plans for contingent funding needs. It is also important for senior management to be aware of the interdependence between liquidity and capital levels, recognizing that liquidity issues can negatively affect capital adequacy and the reverse is also true. To effectively handle periods of financial instability, banks should hold substantial reserves of easily accessible, high-quality liquid assets that are free from any encumbrances.",

This includes both funding liquidity risk, which involves challenges raising funds from wholesale markets or depositors; and collateral liquidity risk, concerning the availability of high-quality liquid assets pledged as collateral during periods of market stress. Evaluating these risks requires banks to assess unsecured borrowing limits across different currencies, consider concentration limits within trading relationships, evaluate intraday credit lines, review contingency funding plans, analyze settlement failures, and understand netting agreements and bilateral trade exposures between counterparties.

The reduction should be a minimum of 15% for one year of overdue payments, 25% for two years, and increase by 10% for each subsequent year of overdue payments.",
            "generated_answer": "When determining the Net Asset Value for calculating the Capital-Asset Ratio, preference dividend arrears must be deducted from the company's net assets. Similarly, if cumulative redeemable convertible preference share debentures have accrued interest that remains unpaid after three months, this also needs to be deducted; however, unutilized revenue reserves can be added back as per Rule 7(5). If an amount payable by way of redemption has remained overdue for more than nine months, it should also be reduced from the asset side while computing capital adequacy norms. However, amounts representing accumulated preferential payments may still qualify as Tier I capital even though they are due but outstanding.",

An account's asset classification can stay the same or improve after a set time if the borrower meets the requirements for special regulatory consideration and performs as expected.

The property must be intended for the NBFC-UL's direct use and easily saleable without legal obstacles; also, these revaluation reserves must be distinctly reported in the financial statements. Revaluations should be realistic and aligned with prevailing accounting standards. Independent valuations from two external valuers must be obtained at a minimum of once every three years. Any significant decline in value must be promptly addressed through revaluation and incorporated into capital adequacy assessments. Furthermore, the external auditors' opinion on the revaluation should be unqualified.",

Revaluations must occur at least annually using values determined by prices or valuations readily available for marketable securities; if unavailable, reliable valuation techniques compliant with International Accounting Standards Board standards should be used. Changes in management-approved policies regarding asset revaluation can only reduce positive revaluation reserves after deducting accumulated depreciation. Furthermore, any impairment losses on assets must take precedence over additions to revaluation reserves during periods when the net book value exceeds realisable/value-in-use/ carrying amount.

            "generated_answer": "If a bank has not yet opened a separate escrow or payment aggregation account for a merchant aggregator that was previously using a former nodal account, it may consider factoring these payments into the Core portion. This allows banks to still participate effectively within this arrangement while ensuring compliance moves towards separation of accounts by April 1st next year when applicable.",

This encompasses government securities surpassing the obligatory SLR limit, as well as those permitted under the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) and the Facility to Avail Liquidity for Liquidity Coverage Ratio (FALLCR) within the mandatory SLR. The cumulative HQLA allocation from the mandatory SLR can be considered when adhering to LCR requirements, up to a defined percentage of the bank's Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL).",
            "generated_answer": "Banks must ensure that their investments align strictly within regulatory limits set by both LCR and SLR guidelines. To meet these requirements, they may utilize Government Securities for Liquidity Support purposes under Pillar 3 disclosures without impacting capital adequacy or Risk Weighted Assets calculations; however, no single security should be considered as providing liquidity support beyond its outstanding face value. Additionally, instruments eligible for inclusion towards compliance include all types of G-Secs held above minimum requirement but excluding those classified as HFT/EFSF/EIF/CBFN/PSI-EFSF/SOFRS as defined in paragraphs 149-50 of Master Circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.286/27.06.000/2008-09 dated June 11, 2009, updated from time to time.

            "ground_truth_answer": "For a bank to write off an unrealized export bill, the bill must have been outstanding for more than one year. The exporter needs to demonstrate sufficient attempts to recover the funds and must have maintained a regular banking relationship for a minimum of six months, adhering to Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) guidelines. The bank must also be convinced of the transaction's genuineness and the situation must align with specific scenarios. These scenarios include the insolvency of the buyer, resolution via an Indian Embassy, destruction of goods by customs or other authorities, inability to locate the buyer, an outstanding balance not surpassing 10% of the invoice value, legal expenses that are excessively high relative to the outstanding amount, or instances where bills are rejected because of inconsistencies in value or freight costs.",
            "generated_answer": "When an exporter's goods have arrived at their destination but no invoice or bill was sent by the seller due to reasons beyond his control, such as civil unrest preventing dispatch from neutral ports after transit via Iran/Port Sudan, destruction of shipping documents during transit through Yemen/Horn of Africa leading to cargo abandonment, loss or damage to shipped goods before reaching the port of shipment affecting the ability to issue invoices within 30 days, or default of foreign buyers accepting deferred payments without intent to pay. In these cases, banks may allow full or partial writing-off of such accounts receivable if they verify that legitimate attempts were made under extraordinary conditions to realize the amount according to guidelines issued periodically by DGFT, Directorate General Foreign Trade Policy Department, Ministry of Commerce & Industry Government of India.

            "ground_truth_answer": "According to regulatory guidelines, when the Date for Commencement of Commercial Operations (DCCO) for a project loan is extended, but remains within permissible extended timeframes, and if the funding of any cost overruns adheres to specific regulatory conditions, the loan is categorized as a 'restructured standard' asset. This classification necessitates a provisioning of 5% from the date of restructuring. This provisioning must continue until the project achieves commencement of commercial operations, or for a period of two years from the restructuring date, whichever occurs later. The loan's classification can be elevated to 'standard' once the entire project reaches its commencement of commercial operations.",
            "generated_answer": "If a loan's DCCO extension aligns with regulatory guidelines regarding cost increases due to changes like revised DPR or project scaling up within stipulated limits, it maintains its original asset classification. The pre-DCCO interest accrual freeze continues after the DCCO, but provisions can be reversed if they exceed provisions drawn during the period between originally scheduled commercial operations commencement date and one year post-extended DCCO upon repayment of additional funds raised from lenders or promoters, without altering net profit calculations.",

Deciding whether to restructure an advance requires a comprehensive evaluation of the entity's potential for success, quick identification of any shortcomings, and the swift implementation of restructuring strategies. Restructuring is appropriate only when the borrower's financial soundness is confirmed and there is strong confidence in repayment under the new terms. Important metrics to consider include Return on Capital Employed, Debt Service Coverage Ratio, and the margin between the Internal Rate of Return and the Cost of Funds. If an account is not likely to succeed financially, restructuring should not be pursued, and instead, recovery actions should take precedence.",
            "generated_answer": "When a bank restructures an advance, it aims to ensure that borrowers can repay their debts while also allowing them sufficient time for business recovery. To determine whether restructuring is necessary, banks must assess various factors such as the borrower's credit rating, debt-equity ratio, repayment history, current cash generation capacity relative to debt obligations, future earnings potential, and any external support available. The goal is to identify viable accounts where loan terms need adjustment rather than write-off.

            "ground_truth_answer": "As part of the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), a bank's comprehensive evaluation of its capital requirements should detail the methodology used to ascertain these needs. This evaluation should take into account elements like the inherent unpredictability associated with modeling techniques, deficiencies in risk management protocols, discrepancies between regulatory capital and internal capital, and the diverse functions of capital, which encompass shareholder returns, objectives related to credit ratings, avoiding regulatory actions, safeguarding against unforeseen events, protecting depositors, providing working capital, and facilitating strategic acquisitions.",

            "generated_answer": "When an asset's classification changes due to a restructuring plan that includes partial repayment through FITL, non-fund-based credit facilities (NFBFCFs), or otherwise, any interest accrued during this period can be recognized as unrealised income. Furthermore, if debt or equity investments acquired under the Restructured Standard Account Scheme are converted into shares via settlement plans involving lenders other than banks/non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), any capital market gains realized upon sale of these shares can also be accounted for by recognizing them as unrealized income.

Under these circumstances, the term loan and the new short-term loan can be regarded as current obligations and not be classified as a non-performing asset (NPA). The classification of these assets will be determined by the updated terms, and they will be treated as NPA according to the established guidelines for classifying agricultural advances.",
            "generated_answer": "When a short-term production loan for agriculture or allied activities becomes overdue due to a natural calamity, it should be treated as an advance covered under long term credit plans. It will not automatically be classified as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA).

            "generated_answer": "Scheduled commercial banks in India can include up to 1.5% of total risk-weighted assets for items classified under Additional Tier 1 Capital within their Total Tier 1 Capital requirements. This means that AT1 instruments cannot exceed more than 90 basis points above this amount when calculating Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio. The maximum amount included must be adjusted if it results in an unduly high CET1 ratio relative to RWAs; however, there should not normally be any reduction for PNCB or NCB stock exceeding 35%.",

This definition extends to entities within an International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in India. A key characteristic of a foreign entity is its limited liability structure. This structure is present in entities like limited liability companies and limited liability partnerships, where the liability of the person resident in India is clearly defined and limited to their contribution or interest in the entity. In the case of investment funds or vehicles that are regulated by financial sector regulators in the host jurisdiction and are structured as trusts outside India, the liability of the person resident in India should not exceed their interest or contribution to the fund. Additionally, the trustee of such a fund must be a person resident outside India.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "For Credit Default Swaps (CDS) transacted over-the-counter (OTC), a bank employing the Current Exposure Method calculates counterparty exposure by factoring in the collaterals and margins held by each participant in the market.",
            "generated_answer": "The current exposure method for credit default swaps involves calculating an add-on amount. This calculation considers factors such as the reference or deliverable obligation's notional principal or outstanding position ('N'), the adjustment factor 'a' used when adjusting the effective maturity of the CDS premium payment period relative to its original value at t = 0 days, where 't' represents calendar time, and 'T' denotes settlement date, which should be included if it falls within ten years from issue or issuance. The formula N x max { [9 - log10(T-t)], O } x a may apply under specific conditions; otherwise, an alternative approach must be used. If cash margins are posted daily against each transaction, no additional capital requirements arise beyond holding high-quality liquid assets to cover potential future exposures. However, if cash margining is done periodically instead of daily, provisions exist regarding minimum initial margin amounts, variation margin accounting periods, permissible offsets between grossed-up positions, treatment of payments received prior to offsetting cash receipts, and determination of net open claims using specified formulas.",

The fast pace of innovation in securitisation methods and instruments can magnify these risks. The minimum capital requirements outlined in Pillar 1 might not adequately cover all of these risks. Therefore, a bank's Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) should address these risks thoroughly. This assessment should include evaluations of credit, market, liquidity, and reputational risks, possible defaults and losses on the assets underlying the securitisation, exposures arising from credit lines or liquidity facilities provided to special purpose entities, and exposures resulting from guarantees extended by third parties.",
            "generated_answer": "Securitization involves various credit, market, liquidity, legal/regulatory compliance, and reputational risk exposures. The Pillar 1 minimum requirement may not capture several key aspects like exposure to counterparty risk associated with repo-style transactions or lack of diversification benefits from assets held in special purpose vehicles; reliance on internal ratings which may vary significantly across issuers; dependence on third-party credit assessments potentially subjecting bank's balance sheet to external shocks; uncertainties regarding future contractual cash flows affecting valuation; reliance upon timely redemption proceeds; uncertainty over collateral quality and its impact on repayment capacity; potential concentration risk due to similar economic characteristics shared by underlying assets; susceptibility to rapid deterioration if counterparties default; reliance on securitized asset values as primary source of recovery during insolvency proceedings; effects stemming from changes in accounting standards impacting current practices.

This registration must be done using a verified mobile phone number and a self-certified 'Officially Valid Document (OVD)' as defined in the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Know Your Customer Direction 2016.

            "ground_truth_answer": "The guidelines stipulate that variable pay for Key Management Personnel (KMPs) and senior management can consist of share-linked instruments, cash, or a mix of both, always adhering to legal requirements. The amount of variable pay should correspond to the person's role and associated risks, increasing with greater responsibility. This pay must be genuinely variable, with the possibility of being reduced to zero depending on the performance of the individual, the business unit, or the entire company. The company's board can decide to defer a portion of the variable pay, taking into account the time frame of the risks involved. Compensation for individuals in control and assurance roles should be separate from the business areas they supervise, featuring a larger fixed component but still including variable pay to enable malus or clawback mechanisms.",
            "generated_answer": "The variable portion of remuneration should align closely with individual performance. The maximum permissible variable pay component varies between 25% and 30%, contingent upon factors such as organizational or business unit size and risk profile. It must be clearly defined at the time of contract signing; however, it can vary annually based on assessed performance outcomes. Unpaid deferred amounts may not be reinstated if they have been reduced due to deductions under operating loss rules. Deferrals of unvested equity must occur through shares withheld from vesting rather than cash payments. Equity awards subject to market-based conditions that haven't vested by March 31st each year also qualify for deferral treatment until March 31st next year. However, any dividends paid during the deferral period cannot be included when calculating final payout values after re-valuation adjustments.",

In this formula, CP represents the crystallized portfolio, C is the total claims received in prior years, and SLA denotes the sanctioned limit for each account within the crystallized portfolio. The remaining portion of the defaulted amount is subject to a risk weight based on the counterparty or the Regulatory Retail Portfolio (RRP), as applicable.

            "generated_answer": "Under Basel III, banks must aggregate their individual charges across different time horizons when calculating the total capital requirement for market risk. This involves summing up the largest value among either 10 percent weighted average maturity or an effective duration-based calculation over all interest rate maturities. The resulting aggregated amount then serves as the basis for determining whether additional capital needs to be held under the leverage ratio framework.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "For loans featuring floating interest rates, lenders are required to disclose the benchmark rate, the spread applied to that benchmark, and how often the interest rate will be adjusted. Furthermore, lenders should illustrate how fluctuations in the reference benchmark rate impact the loan, specifically showing how a change, such as a 25 basis point change in the benchmark rate 'R', would affect both the Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) amount and the total number of EMIs required to repay the loan.",
            "generated_answer": "When offering loans with floating, benchmark-based, or variable interest rates, regulated entities must disclose details regarding changes in the reference rate indices used. They should also disclose all costs associated with switching between different loan facilities within their own bank's products and services; any switch-related charges levied by third parties unrelated to the bank's product should be disclosed separately as additional charges for borrower awareness. For existing borrowers facing fresh draws under credit arrangements at higher rates due to deteriorating creditworthiness, banks should clearly state this fact upfront during contract execution.\n\nFurthermore, regulated entities must explain how they would handle instances where reference index values increase beyond established caps if such clauses exist. The calculation methodology for determining future interest amounts should always include compounding effects whenever possible. Banks must avoid using complex mathematical expressions when communicating key facts about these loans to borrowers. If there is a mismatch between the contractual date of drawdown and its actual disbursement, it can impact calculations pertaining only to the amount disbursed after maturity adjustment. Lastly, contracts cannot contain clauses penalizing borrowers who voluntarily prepay or partially repay term loans before scheduled installments begin.",

They also need to communicate any changes to the EMI amount or the loan duration that result from interest rate adjustments. Borrowers must have the option to switch to a fixed interest rate, according to a Board-approved policy that specifies how often such a switch is allowed. Borrowers should also be able to choose to increase their EMI, extend the loan's term, or use a combination of both. Additionally, they should have the option to make partial or full prepayments at any time during the loan, in accordance with regulations on foreclosure charges. All charges for switching from a floating to a fixed rate, along with any other service or administrative fees, must be clearly disclosed in the loan sanction letter and whenever these charges are updated. Institutions need to make sure that extending the loan's term does not result in negative amortization. Borrowers should also receive a quarterly statement that includes details on the principal and interest recovered, the EMI amount, the number of EMIs still to be paid, and the annualized interest rate.",
            "generated_answer": "When offering loan facilities where EMIs for principal and interest repayment remain fixed throughout the term until maturity or payoff, lenders can reset floating interest rate margins. However, any such changes should not negatively impact borrowers who have already made EMI payments according to original terms; if negative impacts occur due to margin resets, all future installments may need adjustment via compromise settlements.

Banks are required to report and finalize these transactions on the Negotiated Dealing System/Negotiated Dealing System-Order Matching (NDS/NDS-OM) platform and settle them through the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd (CCIL) acting as the central counterparty. Physical SGL transfer forms are allowed only in certain exceptional cases, following the established SGL transfer form guidelines.

If a Self-Help Group (SHG) has members who are intentional defaulters, the group is still eligible for financing, provided that these intentional defaulters are excluded from the loan and the details are properly documented. Banks are also advised not to reject loan applications from SHGs simply because family members of individual SHG members have defaulted on loans. Furthermore, individuals who have defaulted for non-intentional reasons should not be prohibited from receiving loans, and in cases where the default is attributable to legitimate circumstances, banks have the option to restructure the credit arrangements.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks should not deny credit facilities or membership to SHGs solely because individual members have defaulted. Even if an SHG has member defaults, it can still receive bank finance through well-defined procedures that ensure funds reach borrowers directly, rather than being used by weak links within the group.

This strategy protects against rising rates while limiting potential gains from falling rates for instruments like floating-rate bonds or loans indexed to short-term market rates.

These conditions include the cash not being segregated, the daily calculation and exchange of variation margin based on mark-to-market valuation, the receipt of cash variation margin in the same currency as the derivative contract's settlement currency, the coverage of the full mark-to-market exposure by the exchanged variation margin, and the inclusion of the derivatives transactions and variation margins under a single master netting agreement stipulating net settlement.",
            "generated_answer": "When determining if cash received or paid under an over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contract can qualify as a form of pre-settlement payment within the leverage ratio framework, several conditions must be met. Firstly, the amount must represent changes in the fair value of the derivatives contracts themselves. Secondly, it should not include payments arising from other factors like interest rate adjustments. Thirdly, these payments need to occur according to predefined contractual provisions rather than being subject to unilateral determination by one party.

Additionally, there shouldn't be clauses allowing unilateral cancellation or increased costs incurred from exercising rights against the guarantee unless agreed upfront between borrower and lender and permitted by regulators. Finally, the guarantee's form needs to clearly indicate it functions as a credit risk mitigant for specific exposures subject to regulatory treatment; otherwise, its value will only serve to reduce counterparty exposure but not underlying assets linked to capital adequacy rules.",

Following receipt of the NOC, the bank must seek approval from either the Central Registrar of Co-operative Societies (CRCS) or the Registrar of Co-operative Societies (RCS) to amend its bye-laws. The final step involves applying to the RBI\u2019s Regional Office with necessary documents, such as board and general body approvals, revised bye-laws, a copy of the Certificate of Registration (CoR) showing the new name, and the original banking license.",
            "generated_answer": "A co-operative bank can amend its bye-laws through a general body meeting to include changes like altering or adding new words to its title. However, if the bank wants to completely alter its full name or incorporate any other substantial amendment not covered by Section 30(2), it requires prior approval from the Registrar of Co-operatives Societies (RoCS). If the RoCs has merged with another government department such as the National Housing Bank (NHB) or Deposit Insurance & Credit Guarantee Corporation Ltd., then permission needs to be sought from that specific department for amending the bye-laws including changing the name of the cooperative banks. After obtaining this approval, amendments need to be made in the Bye-Laws / Rules and Regulations of the Cooperative Banks incorporating all necessary changes after due consultation with the concerned State Government/Union Territory Administration and passing the same at General Body Meeting. Subsequently, an application should also be submitted under Rule 18 of O.M. No.III-7(CoB)-94/2016 dated September 05, 2016 along with copies of amended Bye Laws/Rules&Regulations duly certified by Auditors and copy of Certificate of Registration issued by RoC/SRTC bearing date before April 1st preceding the year in which the application is filed with the Department of Supervision, RBI, Mumbai Region.

Furthermore, should the second payment leg remain outstanding after five business days, the bank having made the initial payment is mandated to apply a risk weight of 1250% to the total transferred value, in addition to any applicable replacement costs.

            "ground_truth_answer": "In International Financial Services Centres (IFSCs), a currency option is a standardized foreign exchange derivative contract traded on recognized stock exchanges. The buyer of the currency option has the right, but not the obligation, to either buy, using a call option, or sell, using a put option, a specific amount of currency at a predetermined price, known as the strike price, on a future date. Conversely, the seller of the currency option is obligated to sell, in the case of a call option, or buy, in the case of a put option, the currency if the buyer chooses to exercise their right.",
            "generated_answer": "A currency option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell one currency against another at specified prices. The writer or seller has no choice once they agree to be bound by this contract; if someone buys their written call options, they will provide them with foreign exchange units upon exercise, regardless of prevailing market rates. Conversely, if put options are exercised, it obligates the seller to purchase local currency from the purchaser using available funds or assets sourced through legitimate means according to current guidelines. If there's insufficient available resources, the writer must use any legally permitted method for acquiring sufficient amounts. Options can also be used as hedging tools between two parties involved in international trade transactions denominated in different currencies. In these cases, each party may write opposite options covering the same amount and maturity dates. However, unless specifically allowed otherwise, the settlement date cannot precede that of underlying contracts entered into before October 16th, 2007.",

The secured portion of the doubtful asset requires provisioning at rates between 20% and 100%, based on the length of time the asset has been classified as doubtful.",

If there's no clear idea about recovery from available collateral, 100% of such advances should be provided for. Additionally, if any part of the debt is not backed by tangible securities like fixed assets charged as per the sanctioned security, it must also warrant provisions at that level; however, deductions can only apply when all other factors remain unchanged except for being fully covered by cash margins, deposits, shares, debentures, bonds, etc., which may then qualify for zero provision.",

Banks have the option to utilize any available financial collateral to offset this. To mitigate the effect on quarterly earnings, these provisions can be distributed across a maximum of four quarters, beginning with the quarter in which the fraud was identified. Should the complete provisioning extend beyond a single financial year, the 'other reserves' account will be debited for the portion of the amount that has not yet been provisioned by the end of the year. This debit will be reversed proportionally, and the profit and loss account will be debited in subsequent quarters. Banks are also obligated to disclose the total number of fraud incidents, the corresponding monetary values, the provisions that have been established, and any unamortized provisions that have been debited from the 'other reserves' account.",
            "generated_answer": "When fraud is identified or suspected in any form for any borrower account, banks should immediately make full provisions. Additionally, they must disclose details regarding instances where fraud was detected during credit appraisal or post-sanction follow-up by classifying such accounts as fraud, providing quantitative information about fund loss due to fraud across different sectors and industries. Banks also need to reveal their exposure to borrowers involved in multiple fraud cases to facilitate comprehensive sectoral analysis at various levels; if loans have already been fully written off but still exposed to further potential losses from fraud detection, these write-offs can be treated separately under 'Others'.",

This deduction applies regardless of whether the investment is in the Additional Tier 1 (AT1) or Tier 2 capital of the entity in which the bank is investing.",
            "generated_answer": "When calculating Common Equity Tier 1 Capital for regulatory purposes, investments in equity shares or debt securities issued by non-consolidated banking/financial/non-financial subsidiaries are deducted according to their corresponding capital tiers. For example, if an instrument falls under Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital but does not qualify as CET1 capital after deducting goodwill, then this instrument would be deducted from either AT1/Tier-2 capital when computing Regulatory Adjusted Capital Base (RCB).",

            "ground_truth_answer": "For Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDIs) issued in foreign currency, the 'eligible amount' is defined as the higher value between 1.5% of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) and the total Additional Tier 1 capital, based on calculations from March 31 of the preceding financial year. Banks have the option to issue a maximum of 49% of this 'eligible amount' through foreign currency bonds, rupee-denominated bonds overseas, or a combination of both.",
            "generated_answer": "The eligible amount refers to the higher value between 1.5 times the minimum Tier I capital prescribed by the relevant regulatory authority under applicable prudential norms at any given time, excluding goodwill, intangible assets, investments accounted for using either the fair value model or amortized cost method, all other items included within equity instruments outside Tier-I and Tier-II capital if deducted from CET1 Capital when calculating CRAR, and any reduction made due to translation adjustment; and 70% of the total Additional Tier-1 capital maintained by banks which meets Basel III requirements at the end of the preceding quarter, subject to prior approval from concerned regulator. The maximum issuance cannot exceed an aggregate of 49% of the eligible amount collectively across various forms of Non-SLR claims without violation of existing conditions and limits specified therein. Banks must raise funds equal to at least half of their foreign currency bond issue through borrowing from entities incorporated outside India, while raising no more than one-third of the total foreign currency debt through fresh borrowings out of their resources available abroad. \n\nFor Rupee Denominated Bonds: At least 2/3rd of the gross inflow received from sale of such bonds should be invested in India, calculated based upon the net proceeds of similar securities being offered by them according to applicable laws and guidelines. If any amount remains uninvested beyond six months post date of receipt then the same has to repatriated immediately. A bank may retain upto 8% of the outstanding balance in its Foreign Currency Account in accordance with FEMA provisions for meeting future obligations like redemption etc. This facility does not apply towards retention of profits, dividends or interest payments made on account of loans / advances availed against Overseas Deposits.",

            "generated_answer": "To ensure segregation of duties within treasury operations, only authorized personnel who have not been involved in negotiating or executing trades should be entrusted with making decisions regarding purchases and sales. This separation helps prevent fraud by requiring multiple parties to approve actions independently before they occur. The specific roles may vary between government and corporate debt instruments due to differences in their acquisition procedures; however, both categories require adequate checks during trade processing. For example, while an SGL Accountant can verify details from the official Gazette, this verification must then be double-checked through another independent process once completed.",

The application must include a valid justification for the name change and approval from the bank's General Body. Following this, the bank seeks amendments to its bye-laws from the Central Registrar of Co-operative Societies (CRCS) or the Registrar of Co-operative Societies (RCS).

If the total amount payable exceeds 10 percent of the bank's eligible capital base at any time during the year under review, it constitutes significant risk exposure requiring mitigation measures such as debt reduction, asset sale or conversion into equity/debt-capital.

The remaining uncovered part of the exposure is assigned the risk weight of the original counterparty, in accordance with applicable regulations. As an example, exposures backed by State Government guarantees are assigned a risk weight of 20 percent.",

The Protected Exposure Framework determines the capital adequacy requirements after considering these protections. For instance, if an issue-specific guarantee exists, it will protect only that portion of the underlying obligation covered under the guarantee terms. However, if there's a shortfall between the amount of debt service due and the available cash flows from project operations at any point during this timeframe, all residual risks would be assigned the higher risk weight applicable to the original counterparty within the regulated bank group; the unsecured part attracts a 150% risk weight while the remaining exposed part attracting a risk weight based upon its residual maturity.",

A CCF of 50% is applied to these commitments with an original maturity exceeding one year. Commitments that the bank can unconditionally cancel at any time without notice, or those with automatic cancellation provisions due to a decline in the borrower's credit quality, are assigned a 10% CCF.",
            "generated_answer": "For calculating exposures beyond one year that include both revolving facilities and non-revolving facilities like construction or term loans drawn over several years, banks use a progressive approach. They apply different credit conversion factors (CCFs), such as 100% if less than three months, increasing percentages thereafter up until five years, depending upon maturity. For example:\n\n- If an aggregate commitment has been sanctioned at \u20b95 crore bearing maturity period of two years but actual funds have not yet been disbursed fully and outstanding balance remains below \u20b93 crores, then it will attract CCF = 75%. The exposure reckoned under this item would be \u20b949286, i.e., Outstanding Balance * Credit Conversion Factor, where outstanding balance = \u20b93 Crore; therefore, \u20b93 Crore*75%=\u20b949286.\n- If another facility having same maturity period of two years bears disbursement schedule spread across time and fund out standing exceeds \u20b93crore e.g. Fund outstanding balance = \u20b94 crore, Then It shall attract CCF = 100%, Exposure Reckonable Under This Item Would Be \u20b94 Crore *Credit Conversion factor, Where Outstandings Balances=\u20b94 Crore Therefore, \u20b94 Crore*100%=\u20b94 Crore.\n\nThe total exposure considered should never exceed the actual limit.",

            "question": "Why do banks use stress testing, and what advantages does it provide for managing risk and planning capital?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "Stress testing is an essential method that banks use to manage risks by predicting possible negative effects associated with different types of risks. It enables banks to evaluate their capital requirements to withstand losses resulting from major economic or financial shocks. The benefits of stress testing include providing future-oriented risk evaluations, improving the shortcomings of models and historical information, aiding in communication, guiding capital and liquidity planning, establishing risk tolerance levels, handling risk concentrations, and enabling the creation of risk mitigation strategies.",
            "generated_answer": "Stress tests help bank management understand potential vulnerabilities under adverse conditions. They can be used by board members and senior executives as quantitative decision-making tools when evaluating new business plans or strategies. Stress test results should inform managers about adequate levels of capital buffers relative to their desired confidence level regarding future outcomes. The approach also provides forward-looking information beyond historical data's limitations; however, there may still be risks not fully captured through these tests, so other methods like scenario analysis must supplement them. Banks develop internal policies outlining how they will respond if certain thresholds set during pre-set scenarios are breached. These responses could include adjusting credit standards, reducing exposures, increasing provisions, altering dividends/rewards/repurchases, expanding loss-absorbing capacity, or augmenting capital funds via share issuance or debt instruments.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "To mitigate risks associated with unsecured guarantees, Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks should ensure that their unsecured guarantee commitments are not excessively concentrated within particular customer segments or sectors. It is essential that the Board of Directors defines suitable limits for unsecured guarantees extended to individual customers. These limits should be determined by considering the ratio of total unsecured guarantees and the multiple of the customer's shareholdings in the bank.",
            "generated_answer": "To mitigate risks associated with concentrated unsecured guarantees, banks must monitor total unsecured guaranteed borrowings. If these exceed 10% of Tier I capital or 25% of aggregate non-fund-based credit exposure, management action plans may be required from boards or senior staff. In extreme cases where borrowers overextend themselves beyond sanctioned limits, bank guarantees might replace funds owed by customers to suppliers or other creditors instead of being used for debt servicing.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "In securitization, implicit support arises when a bank offers financial assistance exceeding its contractual duties. This indicates to the market that the bank still bears the risks associated with the securitized assets. Because this type of support is not contractually required, it is not included in Pillar 1 calculations, it should be a component of the Pillar 2 process and integrated into a bank's Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).",
            "generated_answer": "Implicit support occurs when originators or sponsors provide non-contractual support during securitisations. This can include providing liquidity facilities, credit enhancements beyond contractual obligations, or taking over servicing responsibilities if default rates exceed expectations. Such actions signal to market participants that an entity's risk profile extends outside its balance sheet, potentially leading to undue reliance on these entities without adequate valuation adjustments.

Banks are expected to co-accept only legitimate trade bills, verifying that the goods have been delivered to the borrower's inventory. It is important to confirm the accuracy of the valuation of goods on invoices and to avoid co-accepting accommodation bills. Discounting banks should assess the co-accepting bank's ability to meet the obligation and establish bank-specific limits for discounting co-accepted bills. Banks should also ensure that the co-acceptance liability aligns with their financial resources, regularly confirm the liabilities of co-accepting banks, maintain detailed records, and notify the co-accepting bank's main office of any disproportionate transactions. Branch managers are required to report co-acceptance commitments to their supervisory offices. Co-acceptances exceeding Rs.10,000 should require dual signatures from bank officials. For bills above Rs. 2 lakh, written confirmation from the accepting bank's supervisory office is mandatory, and bills exceeding Rs. 20 lakh for a single borrower necessitate prior approval from the co-accepting bank's head office.",
            "generated_answer": "When banks extend accommodation through co-accepted bills beyond prescribed limits or without proper credit appraisal, they may require customers' bankers to also accept responsibility for meeting payment obligations. However, if such arrangements exist but have not been exercised by the banker at time of default, the bank extending accommodation will be responsible under Section 4(h)(ii) of Negotiable Instruments Act.

If more than half of the repayment cash flows are derived from lease or rental payments, or from the sale of the financed assets, the exposure is generally classified as CRE. Conversely, if the repayment is primarily dependent on aspects such as operating profits from business operations or the quality of goods and services provided, then it is generally not classified as CRE.",

The bank's Board of Directors is responsible for actively monitoring the progress to guarantee compliance with the established timelines.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks must establish an internal timeline approved by their Board of Directors or similar body within three months from December 31st. This plan should ensure that at least one-third of existing cash dispensing ATM machines undergo cassette swap every year thereafter until March 2024; this includes all newly installed ATMs. Banks also need to implement effective monitoring mechanisms at both regional and central levels to track progress across various states/UTs through State Level Bankers' Committees (SLBC), Zonal SLBC meetings, and other forums, taking necessary actions if implementation falls behind schedule. A review mechanism will be developed, implemented, and monitored centrally using information provided by Regional Offices/Centres for Banking Operations (RO-CBO).

This means the complexity of risk measurement and management practices should match the bank's size, the range of its activities, and the complexity of its operations. Banks with less complex operations may use simpler methods, whereas banks with more complex operations should use more advanced methods.",
            "generated_answer": "The principles underlying the ICAAP must align with an institution's size, complexity, risk profile, geographic footprint, business model, scope of operations, etc., as well as its objectives. Banks that operate under stricter regulatory frameworks due to their higher risks may not require additional controls beyond these standards if they maintain adequate capital buffers or have robust risk management systems.

These standards require the guarantees to be direct, explicit, irrevocable, and unconditional. However, if these guarantee schemes limit the maximum claims allowed via features like specified guarantee coverage, first loss absorption, or payout caps, the zero percent risk weight applies only up to the maximum claim amount. Any remaining exposure is risk-weighted based on the counterparty involved.",

The remaining exposure beyond such limits will have a risk-weight as applicable to borrowers/counterparties or their rating or credit assessment category.

            "ground_truth_answer": "For positions hedged using Credit Default Swaps (CDS), a bank can fully offset specific risk capital charges if the values of the CDS and the hedged position demonstrate consistent movement in opposite directions and to the same degree. This typically occurs when the CDS is an exact match for the hedged position. Banks may offset 80% of specific risk capital charges when the values of the CDS and the hedged position move in opposite directions, but not to the same degree. An example is a long cash position hedged by a CDS with an exact match in reference obligation and maturity. This partial offset is conditional on the absence of key features in the CDS that could cause significant price deviations.",
            "generated_answer": "When determining specific risk capital requirements for exposures covered by purchased credit default swaps (CDS), banks can apply a 2% or lower mismatch between underlying exposure maturity and CDS maturities. For fully hedged protection where no maturity mismatch exists, only the notional amount difference needs to be specified when calculating the specific risk charge. However, if there's an uncovered portion due to a maturity mismatch greater than two years, the specific risk requirement applies to both the derivative position referencing the reference entity and any residual unhedged exposure resulting from the transaction. The formula used depends on whether the maturity of the hedge instrument is more or less than that of the underlying obligation. In cases involving foreign currency obligations where the payment will occur at different times compared to the settlement date of a foreign exchange derivative contract, separate calculations must be performed considering this time discrepancy.",

The increased HTM limit of 23% of NDTL, which was available for securities acquired between September 1, 2020, and March 31, 2023, was later extended until March 31, 2024.

            "generated_answer": "The revised framework allows commercial banks an additional 10% beyond existing limits for SLR securities classified under the Held to Maturity (HTM) category. The total HTM investment ceiling remains unchanged at 23 percent or \u20b97.58 lakh crore, whichever is lower; therefore, any increase within this overall limit due to the revision's implementation will need to be compensated by reducing other eligible investments categorized under HTM. This compensation must occur no later than September 30, FY24-25.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "A bank guarantee remains valid as long as the underlying agreement is being performed. It remains in effect until all governmental debts are settled, claims are fulfilled, or the appropriate authority confirms the contractor's satisfactory completion of the agreement and releases the guarantee. The bank's responsibility is contingent on receiving any demands or claims in written form prior to a predetermined date; after this date, the bank is absolved of its obligations under the guarantee.",
            "generated_answer": "The expiry date or dates stipulated for performance under a bank guarantee constitute an integral part of that instrument. The specific circumstances determining whether a bank's liability has expired or lapsed must be clearly defined within the guarantee itself; it cannot merely state that payment will cease after two years from issuance without specifying any conditions regarding invocation by the beneficiary. If such details aren't included, banks remain liable until all claims have been satisfied or formally rejected upon examination.",

            "question": "In what situations are personal guarantees regarded as beneficial when providing loans to companies with closely held shares, and who is generally favored to act as the guarantor?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "In lending to companies with closely held shares, personal guarantees are useful when the shares are held by individuals or connected parties, excluding professionals or government entities, and when the financial condition or security isn't the main factor. The main shareholders of the borrowing company are usually preferred as guarantors, instead of directors or managerial staff.",
            "generated_answer": "When lending institutions provide financing for companies whose shareholding lacks dispersion among family members or other shareholders, a personal guarantee from key individuals like promoters, directors, managerial personnel, or major shareholders can be advantageous. This approach aims to safeguard lender interests by leveraging individual accountability tied directly to company performance and asset security. Typically, lenders favor individuals connected through shareholdings rather than unrelated parties; however, if such connections exist only at director level without significant share ownership, these individuals may still qualify as appropriate guarantors despite their limited influence within the management structure.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "To support the shift from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to alternative reference rates (ARRs) for existing External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) and Trade Credits (TCs), a one-time adjustment has been implemented on the all-in-cost ceiling. This adjustment raises the ceiling by 100 basis points, establishing revised limits of 550 bps above the ARR for ECBs and 350 bps above the ARR for TCs. This modification is specifically applicable to ECBs and TCs that were initially linked to LIBOR and are undergoing a benchmark transition to ARRs.",
            "generated_answer": "For Existing ECBs/TCs switching from LIBOR-based benchmarks to Alternative Reference Rates (ARR), the all-in-cost ceiling will be revised upwards by 100 basis points. The revised cost cap is determined as per the formula: All-in-Cost Cap = ARR + [Floor rate - Floor benchmark] x n + Additional margin, where 'n' ranges between 75bp and 200 bp depending upon the tenor, risk profile etc., ensuring an equivalent degree of protection against creditworthiness deterioration relative to USD LIBOR. However, if the issuer's incremental Credit Default Swap spread over US Treasuries exceeds this additional margin, then the difference would not be factored into arriving at the final capped amount. This means the maximum permissible floor shall not exceed 300 bps above the USD FRAs quoted by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt Ltd/FIMMDA or other specified FRA rates on any given day; however, if such value crosses this limit due to market conditions but remains within the overall higher floor of USD FRAs plus 400 bps, it can still qualify under these guidelines. For borrowers without available CDS data, the credit premium component should align closely with historical differences observed between similar-rated corporate bonds and government securities across various rating categories and maturity profiles.",

Methods for equity capital repayment, such as share buy-backs, investments in a bank's own shares (treasury stock), or dividend payments from reserves, are typically not permitted.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks seeking to redeem or repurchase equity shares from individual shareholders for reasons other than consolidation cannot do so unless they first obtain prior approval from the Department of Regulation. However, buybacks can occur due to mergers or consolidations if specific requirements like CAR meeting regulatory norms without the redeemed share counted as NPAs/ERPs, and any resulting loss not causing CAR to fall below minimum levels, are met; also ensuring no dividend declaration/payment until all buyback procedures conclude and net profit includes the accounting year's profits minus dividends paid during previous years. Additionally, buybacks under these circumstances require Board approval after reviewing the impact on CRAR and future cash generation projections, with restrictions on further dividend payments if dividends were reduced/paid out of free reserves. The total amount spent on buy backs should be less than 25% of the average quarterly Net Owned Fund over the four quarters immediately preceding the date of announcement.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "Stress testing enables banks to identify possible risks before they materialize. It helps banks evaluate their capital requirements in the event of major economic disruptions and enhances existing risk management procedures. Furthermore, it facilitates anticipatory risk assessments and addresses the shortcomings of relying solely on models.",
            "generated_answer": "Stress tests serve as an integral component of a comprehensive risk management system. They help banks identify potential adverse outcomes for various risks or sets of correlated exposures under extreme conditions that may not be representative of normal market behavior. The results can inform capital planning processes by providing forward-looking indicators relevant to assessing current and future capital adequacy, informing new product development, managing concentrations in business lines and assets, making changes to internal limits, determining contingency plans, setting strategic direction, allocating resources among activities, and establishing pricing disciplines. Stress test scenarios should cover all significant risk factors across a broad range of economic environments, including recessions and periods of high inflation. For instance, interest rate-related instruments require scenario analysis addressing parallel shocks; non-interest rate risks must include liquidity mismatches, concentration risk, credit events like default rates exceeding historical norms, asset price shocks, delinquency spikes, counterparty deterioration, and contract maturity mismatches. Banks should conduct at least annual exercises using quantitative tools integrated into their day-to-day risk measurement procedures rather than relying solely on qualitative assessments.",

Banks' internal audits should incorporate assessments of branch performance in serving pensioner customers, employing questionnaires and random inquiries to measure satisfaction. Banks are also advised to ensure timely pension payments, address delays in dearness relief revisions, maintain structured interactions with pensioners, obtain nominations for pension accounts, facilitate the conversion of accounts to joint status where relevant, and provide effective complaint redressal mechanisms.",
            "generated_answer": "To ensure smooth pension payments, agency banks should establish toll-free dedicated pension lines staffed by trained personnel with database access. These centers must address complaints promptly through a structured grievance redressal mechanism involving senior bank officials at both district and regional levels.

This is based on the fair value, which is derived from the prices or Yield to Maturity (YTM) of Central Government securities with similar tenors, as published by Financial Benchmarks India Private Ltd (FBIL).

However, exceptions exist for unincorporated entities like Hindu Undivided Families, where individual guarantors may be required if there's an issue regarding shareholding or control. For incorporated concerns owned by a single promoter family, joint liability guarantees will typically suffice; however, non-promoter directors of the borrowing concern must also guarantee bank loans unless it would be impractical due to their professional obligations. In cases involving more than one promoter family, guarantees from all families connected through shares or management are necessary. If multiple firms within a corporate body own 25% each, guarantees from at least two major promoters might cover other members.

            "ground_truth_answer": "According to Basel III guidelines, a bank can include minority interest from common shares issued by a fully consolidated subsidiary in its Common Equity Tier 1 capital only when the shares meet the requirements for common share classification and the subsidiary is also a bank. The amount recognized is the total minority interest less any surplus Common Equity Tier 1 capital held by the subsidiary that is attributable to minority shareholders. Surplus Common Equity Tier 1 capital is determined by subtracting the lower of two amounts from the subsidiary's total Common Equity Tier 1 capital: either the subsidiary's minimum Common Equity Tier 1 requirement plus its capital conservation buffer (which equals 8.0% of the subsidiary's risk-weighted assets), or the portion of the consolidated minimum requirement plus buffer (8.0% of consolidated risk-weighted assets) that corresponds to the subsidiary. The portion of the surplus attributable to minority shareholders is calculated by multiplying the surplus by the percentage of Common Equity Tier 1 owned by those shareholders.",
            "generated_answer": "Under Basel III regulations, banks can incorporate minority interest into their Common Equity Tier 1 if it meets specific criteria. Minority interest arises when a bank's consolidated scope includes more than one legal entity engaged solely or primarily in banking activities; this may occur through subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates, investments held as available for sale, non-consolidated special purpose entities like off-balance sheet vehicles, securitization structures, and funds where equity instruments qualify under regulatory requirements. To be included, the issuing bank must hold at least half of the voting rights, while other investors collectively have less than half but sufficient power, protectiveness, and right to receive distributions after all preferential dividends. The eligibility extends only up to 49% dilution relative to ordinary share holdings in the subsidiary. Under Basel III/CRAR calculations, only qualifying items of minimum requirement plus buffers will be recognized, excluding any surplus Common Equity above minimum requirements/buffers. The formula used depends on whether the subsidiary's total balance sheet exceeds USD 80 billion: (i) If not exceeding USD 80 billion - Eligible Additional Tier 1 Capital = Total Minority Interest x r, or (ii) If equaling or exceeding USD 80 billion - Eligible Additional Tier 1 Capital = [Total Minority Interest \u2013(Minority Interest in excess of 50% of the Subordinated Debt)]x r Where 'r' represents the percentage applied which varies according to the extent of loss absorption required for both the bank's own debt and minority shareholders' interests. For instance, if the aggregate losses absorbed by both debt and minority shareholder positions exceed 2% of risk-weighted assets, then the minimum value allowed would become zero, effectively disallowing inclusion altogether.",

            "ground_truth_answer": "A bank can acknowledge a Credit Default Swap (CDS) as a hedge for banking book positions when the exposure to the underlying asset is substituted by the protection seller's exposure, given that operational requirements are satisfied, the risk weight of the protection seller is less than that of the underlying asset, and there isn't a maturity mismatch. If these stipulations are not satisfied, the bank is required to factor in the exposure on the underlying asset and shift the CDS position to the trading book.",

The offsetting transaction must be contracted directly between two eligible parties; if the buyer purchases credit protection from a bank that then hedges its position by purchasing protection from another bank, no protection is recognized under Pillar 1 capital adequacy rules.

            "ground_truth_answer": "When a bank provides credit facilities backed by guarantees from another bank or financial institution, the resulting exposure is classified as an exposure to the guaranteeing entity. Consequently, it is assigned a risk weight in accordance with established regulatory guidelines. Furthermore, these exposures must adhere to the inter-bank exposure limits established by the bank's Board of Directors, which should include specific sub-limits for longer-term exposures to account for their elevated risk profile.",
            "generated_answer": "When granting credit under bank guarantees/standby letters of credit issued by scheduled commercial banks/co-operative banks/FIs/NBFCs, any exposure resulting from these transactions will be treated as an exposure on the guaranteeing/issuing entity. The amount of unexercised guarantee available for lending purposes must adhere to prudential ceilings prescribed for capital market/debt securities investments.

If the bonds are held temporarily, NBFC-UL can acknowledge credit risk mitigation for up to 80% of the covered amount, but the remaining 20% must still be attributed to the original issuer of the bond.

            "ground_truth_answer": "To ascertain capital adequacy, banks are required to assess their exposures, both those with credit ratings and those without. The objective is to confirm that the risk weights allocated according to the Standardised Approach adequately represent the actual risk associated with these exposures. In instances where a bank concludes that the intrinsic risk of an exposure, particularly one lacking a credit rating, is notably greater than the risk weight suggests, the bank is expected to factor in this heightened credit risk in its overall evaluation of capital adequacy. Banks with advanced systems should include risk rating systems, portfolio analysis and aggregation, securitization and complex credit derivatives, and large exposures and risk concentrations in their credit review assessment of capital adequacy.",
            "generated_answer": "To determine the amount of capital needed against an exposure, banks must follow established procedures that consider both quantitative factors like credit ratings and term maturities. They also need to incorporate qualitative aspects such as borrower's performance history, industry sector risks, economic environments, legal environments, currency mismatches, interest rate risk, volatility, leverage ratios, inter-creditor behavior, guarantees, collateral values, repayment records, and debt service coverage ratio. Banks should use historical data when available; if not, they can utilize external sources or seek assistance from rating agencies. The evaluation should include current aging-based provisions and future provisioning requirements under various scenarios to capture potential non-performing assets. Additionally, banks may apply macroeconomic stress tests using Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process tools but cannot entirely rely solely on these results without considering other relevant information. Stress test results will inform management about necessary contingency plans by indicating asset quality deterioration within specific timeframes.",

If the specific provisions held against these loans are in the range of 20% to 50% of the outstanding loan amount, the risk weight is reduced to 75%, again net of specific provisions. If the specific provisions are 50% or more of the outstanding amount, the applicable risk weight is further reduced to 50%.",
            "generated_answer": "When determining the risk-weighted asset figure for banks' balance sheets, if loans or advances against shares, debentures, bonds, or other securities are classified as non-performing assets (NPA), they attract a higher risk weight. However, specific provisions exist regarding collateral; notably, if backed by land and buildings valued at \u20b950 lakh or more, these NPA claims can be assigned a lower risk weight than unsecured ones, even though such properties typically wouldn't qualify under Basel III Capital Regulations due to their illiquid nature.

            "ground_truth_answer": "In situations where a natural disaster diminishes the ability of individuals to repay their debts, existing crop loans, agricultural term loans, and any accumulated interest may be transformed into term loans with revised repayment schedules. The repayment schedule for such restructured loans generally spans three to five years but could be extended to a maximum of seven years, or, under exceptional circumstances, up to ten years. It is advisable to consider a moratorium period of a minimum of one year, and banks should refrain from demanding extra collateral for these restructured loans. Restructured crop loans are regarded as current obligations and are not categorized as non-performing assets (NPA). The categorization of restructured term loans is determined by the revised terms, and they are designated as NPA if interest or principal is overdue for two crop seasons in the case of short-duration crops and for one crop season in the case of long-duration crops.",
            "generated_answer": "In situations where short-term agricultural production loans have been converted into long-term loans due to natural calamities like floods or droughts, banks should reclassify these term loans as non-performing assets only after one year from the date they were rescheduled.

When guarantee amounts exceed Rs. 50 lakhs or the bank deems it necessary due to other factors like risk perception, non-financial risks involved, etc., two authorized signatories must execute them jointly. Banks can establish their own guidelines, subject to approval by their Board, but this level of oversight typically suffices except for extraordinary circumstances requiring three signatures from senior officers at different levels.

Banks should not depend on external consultant reports, especially those from consultants affiliated with the borrowing entity. Banks are also advised to perform sensitivity analyses and scenario planning, particularly for infrastructure projects. These analyses should evaluate the project's viability, taking into account potential delays and cost increases. Moreover, banks are required to confirm the origin and caliber of equity capital from promoters. Banks should ensure that debt from a parent company is not disguised as equity in a subsidiary, as this practice can distort financial ratios.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks must adhere to internal credit policies that ensure proper asset classification, income recognition, provisioning, valuation standards. They also need robust systems for evaluating borrowers' capacity to repay loans promptly using cash flows from assets or external sources, considering both quantitative factors like debt-equity ratio, current ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio, and EBITDA margin; qualitative aspects such as profitability trend, industry position, management quality, technological know-how, marketing ability, and overall economic conditions affecting sectors; and security adequacy including realizable value versus outstanding dues.

These reserves can be used to absorb financial losses during economic downturns. If these capital conservation buffers are reduced, banks should replenish them by decreasing discretionary distributions, including dividend payments, share repurchases, and employee bonuses. Banks may also choose to raise additional capital from financial markets.",
            "generated_answer": "Under Basel III norms, banks must have strategies approved by their boards that detail how they will meet regulatory requirements regarding the total buffer. These strategies should also address dividend/interest payments plans if distributions exceed earnings, share buybacks or employee stock option grants when equity falls below minimum levels, reduction in bonus shares/canceling them altogether after dividends/payouts, deferring staff recruitment or reducing compensation costs, curtailing credit exposures or increasing provisioning against assets under stress, scaling down business expansion plans, selling off non-core activities/banking subsidiaries, and raising new funds from markets.

The standard norms for income recognition and asset classification will be applied to any additional credit facilities sanctioned as part of the rehabilitation package one year after the disbursement date. For additional credit given to Small Scale Industries (SSI) identified as 'sick,' and for which rehabilitation or nursing programs are in place that have been created either by the banks or through consortium agreements, provisioning is not required for the first year.",
            "generated_answer": "When an advance has been classified as sub-standard or doubtful at the time of implementation of a Rehabilitation Package Scheme by term lenders, it will continue to be classified accordingly. However, these accounts benefit from special provisions, requiring a provision ranging between 15% to 30%. This depends on how long ago the asset was downgraded into its current category; loans where assets were upgraded less than one year back require 25%, while others need 30%.

This evaluation should encompass all payments due to the bank, covering both the principal amount and any interest owed. Furthermore, the credit assessment needs to comprehensively capture the credit risk linked to the punctual repayment of both the principal and interest.",
            "generated_answer": "To qualify as an eligible external rating, it must comply with specific criteria under Pillar 2. Additionally, banks should not rely solely on ratings from one agency; instead, they can use multiple agencies' assessments if available at any time during the year or quarter. The rating used by a bank needs to have been assigned no earlier than six months prior to its application date. If a single rating isn't sufficient due to limited availability across all regions, banks may utilize two independent ratings within their jurisdiction when assessing compliance. A 'credit evaluation report,' including both quantitative and qualitative analysis, provides adequate support where only one rating exists but is deemed insufficient without additional data.

Card-issuing banks contribute 1 bps for debit card turnover and 2 bps for credit card turnover (0.01 paisa and 0.02 paisa per Rupee of transaction, respectively).

            "generated_answer": "The amount contributed annually by each card network towards PIDF is determined using a formula: {(Adjusted Card Transactions + 2 x Adjusted International Card Transaction Exports) x Tier}%, where 'Tier' represents different levels set by the Board. The contribution for acquirer banks or issuer banks depends solely on their role as either an acquirer or an issuer; they only contribute if they fall into one category but not both roles simultaneously.

            "ground_truth_answer": "If a loan is sold to an Asset Reconstruction Company (ARC) at a price exceeding its net book value (NBV), the excess provision can be credited to the Profit and Loss Account during the year of the sale, provided that the sale consideration consists exclusively of cash and Security Receipts (SRs) backed by a guarantee from the Government of India. Nevertheless, the portion of the consideration received in SRs must be deducted from CET 1 capital, and dividends cannot be distributed from this specific portion.",

This deduction is made after accounting for any related deferred tax liabilities that would be eliminated if the intangible assets faced impairment or were derecognized, following established accounting standards. This treatment is consistent whether assessing capital at an individual bank level or at a consolidated group level. Consequently, any goodwill and other intangible assets present on the balance sheets of subsidiary companies are also deducted when calculating the consolidated Common Equity.",

In terms of capital adequacy, the exposure is assigned the highest risk weight applicable among all the categories it falls under.",
            "generated_answer": "When an exposure fits within more than one category such as real estate, commercial real estate (CRE), and infrastructure sectors, it should be reported under all applicable categories. However, for regulatory exposure limit purposes, the exposure will only be considered once, even if it falls into several specified sectors or sub-sectors. For instance, infrastructure finance can simultaneously qualify for exposure limits designated for both infrastructure sector loans and priority sector lending; thus, inclusion in either sector does not necessitate double-counting towards exposure ceilings. Similarly, while agriculture financing qualifies as credit granted to farmers and also meets other defined criteria like being part of renewable energy projects or affordable housing schemes, it may count toward multiple objectives but remains capped by single borrower-wise limits. Exposures meeting definitions beyond Schedule 3A include guarantees extended against agricultural debt through NCGTC/GNFC/other entities, which then attract specific prudential norms akin to guarantee claims from non-banking companies.",

If the shortfall equals or exceeds five percent of NDTL, then the penal interest charge will be equal to the bank rate plus 10%.

Banks are required to confirm that legitimate trade bills are used for goods truly received into borrowers' stock accounts and that the valuation of the goods is correct. Co-accepting internal bills or accommodation bills between entities within the same group should be avoided. The ability to co-accept bills exceeding a defined limit should be executed jointly by two authorized personnel.

Branch Managers are responsible for reporting co-acceptance obligations to controlling offices; this report must include details of any overdue bills, which allows for prompt monitoring and intervention.",
            "generated_answer": "Banks must ensure that only genuine trade transactions under bills they co-accept are processed. They also need to verify the genuineness of underlying documents before issuing or co-accepting any bill. Additionally, banks should avoid granting powers of attorney for co-acceptance facilities to their branches; instead, such authority should be exercised by authorized officials at corporate offices.

This reserve should be maintained within the Profit & Loss Account as a floating provision against contingent liabilities resulting from export bids not covered by insurance cover. The amount held aside must be adjusted proportionately if any item becomes doubtful or non-performing during its period of liability. Banks also have discretion to prescribe a lower percentage than 100 percent depending upon their experience regarding the frequency of claims arising out of such guarantees.

This deduction follows a corresponding approach, meaning it's applied to the same capital component (Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, or Tier 2) that would be applicable if the bank directly issued the capital. The deduction from each capital tier is proportional to the holdings in that tier as a percentage of total capital holdings. Any shortfall in a specific tier is deducted from the next higher tier.",
