            "ground_truth_answer": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to discontinue the incremental Cash Reserve Ratio (I-CRR) in a phased manner to ensure that system liquidity is not subjected to sudden shocks and money markets function in an orderly manner. The release of funds impounded under the I-CRR will be conducted in stages, based on an assessment of current and evolving liquidity conditions.",
            "generated_answer": "The Government has decided that banks do not need to maintain an additional Cash Reserve Ratio for March 2024. As such, the I-CRR measure introduced by the Government from June 8, 2023, which was meant to augment general monetary policy measures against inflation, does not apply during this year's April-June quarter. The State Level Banks have been instructed accordingly; hence, there would be no release of funds beyond existing credit limits or previous borrowings under the Comprehensive Credit Plan Scheme for rural development activities up to March end, but these authorities can continue all other programs as per their discretion.",
