This evaluation should account for possible extensions to the loan duration or increases in the EMI amount if benchmark interest rates go up. UCBs should also create guidelines for how they will adjust floating interest rates on these loans.",
            "generated_answer": "When offering floating-rate housing loans, UCBs should ensure borrowers have sufficient margin after considering normal EMI payments. Additionally, any prepayment penalties charged for reducing the loan amount below its minimum value must be reasonable relative to potential gains if no repayment occurred. The UCB may adjust or waive these penalty charges when the borrower demonstrates strong repayment performance during certain specified periods following switch from fixed rate to floating rate or vice-versa. Borrowers can also choose to increase their EMI without penalty when income increases, provided they maintain an appropriate Margin-to-Loan Ratio (MLR).
